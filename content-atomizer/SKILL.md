# Content Atomizer

One article in. Eight platforms out. Each piece native to where it lives.

## Reader-First Reframe (Required Step)

Before writing any platform piece, run the source content through this filter:

**The test:** Can a stranger who has never heard of you use or relate to this right now?

Strangers don't care about your achievements. They care about their own problems. Every piece of atomized content must translate the source material from "here's what I/we did" into "here's what you can do."

| Source framing | Reframed for readers |
|----------------|----------------------|
| "We hit 50k users by doing X" | "The one thing that unlocks your first 50k users" |
| "Bloom now supports Y feature" | "The feature that makes investors actually stick around" |
| "I learned Z from this experience" | "Why Z is the thing most people get backwards" |

If the original content is already reader-first (tutorials, explainers, frameworks), no reframe needed. If it's an achievement, milestone, or update — always reframe.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Copy-pasting the article** — Each platform needs platform-native writing. LinkedIn isn't just a longer tweet. TikTok is a performance, not a summary. Read the platform format guides.
2. **Linking in the LinkedIn body** — External links in the post body suppress LinkedIn reach by 50%+. Always put the article link in the first comment.
3. **Skipping the hook test** — The first post of a thread or first 2 lines of a LinkedIn post is all most people see. If it doesn't compel the click, the rest doesn't matter.
4. **Over-threading** — X threads over 7 posts lose most readers. If the content doesn't demand 7+ posts, stop at 5.
5. **Using tweet-ideas to promote the article** — The standalone tweet drip builds topical authority, not article awareness. No article mentions, no links, no "I wrote about this."
6. **Personal achievement framing** — See Reader-First Reframe above. If the post is about you, it's wrong. Rewrite it about the reader.
