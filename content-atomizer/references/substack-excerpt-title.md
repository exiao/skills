# Substack Excerpt: [title]

### Subject Line
[Use headlines skill, Tier 1 formulas. Under 60 chars. Must work in inbox preview.]

### Preview Text
[The first 40-90 chars that show in email clients next to the subject line. Extend the curiosity gap.]

### Excerpt Body

[OPENING: 2-3 paragraphs from the article - the hook and setup. End on an open loop.]

[BRIDGE: 1-2 sentences that make the reader NEED to see the rest.]

[CLOSING: 1 sentence personal note or teaser for what's coming next week.]
```

**Rules:**
- The excerpt should be 200-400 words. Enough to deliver value, not enough to satisfy curiosity.
- End the excerpt mid-insight. Cut right before the payoff. The reader should feel interrupted.
- Subject line is the most important line. A/B test if your platform supports it.
- Don't summarize the article. Tease it. Summaries kill clicks.
- Preview text (the gray text after the subject in inbox) is free real estate. Use it.
- Include one specific, surprising data point in the excerpt. Numbers earn opens.
- The CTA link should appear after an open loop, not after a conclusion.
