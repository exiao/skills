**Differences from TikTok:**
- YouTube Shorts titles matter for search (TikTok captions don't). Front-load keywords.
- CTA should push subscribes, not follows. "Subscribe" is the word that works on YouTube.
- 30-58 seconds. YouTube's algorithm treats 59-60 second shorts differently (worse).
- Educational content crushes entertainment on Shorts. Be the teacher, not the entertainer.
- Description and hashtags feed YouTube's search algorithm. Use them.
