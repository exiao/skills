# IG Carousel: [title]

**Aspect Ratio:** 4:5 (1080x1350px)
**Font:** Bold sans-serif for headlines, clean serif for body
**Color Scheme:** [match Bloom brand or topic-appropriate palette]

### Slide 1: THE HOOK
**Headline:** [5-8 words, large bold text, centered]
**Subtext:** [1 line that amplifies curiosity, smaller font]
**Visual:** [solid color background or striking image, minimal design]
**Goal:** Stop the scroll. This is a poster, not a page.

Example:
- Headline: "Your Portfolio Is Bleeding Money"
- Subtext: "And you probably don't even know why"

### Slide 2: THE PROBLEM / SETUP
**Headline:** [3-5 words]
**Body:** [2-3 short sentences, max 40 words total]
**Visual:** [icon or simple illustration supporting the point]

Example:
- Headline: "The Hidden Cost"
- Body: "The average investor checks their portfolio 4x per day. Each check costs you money. Not in fees. In behavior."

### Slides 3-7: THE INSIGHTS (one per slide)
**Each slide follows this template:**
- **Headline:** [the insight in 3-6 words]
- **Body:** [1-2 sentences explaining it, max 30 words]
- **Number/Stat:** [if applicable, make it BIG and bold]
- **Visual:** [supporting icon, mini-chart, or illustration]

Rules for middle slides:
- ONE idea per slide. If you need "also" or "and another thing," that's a new slide.
- End each slide with an implicit "and..." to pull them to the next one.
- Vary the layout: some text-heavy, some stat-heavy, some visual-heavy.
- Slide 4 or 5 should be the "Wait, What?" moment (the most surprising data point).

### Slide 8: THE SUMMARY / FRAMEWORK
**Headline:** [the framework name or key takeaway]
**Body:** [bullet list of 3-5 key points from the carousel]
**Visual:** [clean, organized layout, easy to screenshot]

### Slide 9: THE CTA
**Headline:** [clear action: "Save this for later" or "Follow for more"]
**Body:** [1 sentence: why they should follow/save/share]
**Visual:** [arrow pointing to save button, or Bloom app screenshot]

### Slide 10 (optional): THE SHARE SLIDE
**Text:** [A question or provocative statement designed to be shared to Stories]
**Visual:** [minimal, screenshot-friendly design]
```

**Rules:**
- Slide 1 is everything. If slide 1 doesn't stop the scroll, slides 2-10 don't exist.
- Max 40 words per slide. Carousels are visual, not articles.
- Every slide must be legible at phone size. If you have to pinch-zoom, the text is too small.
- Use consistent design language across all slides (same fonts, colors, layout grid).
- The last slide should be saveable/shareable. People screenshot the summary slide.
- No external links (Instagram doesn't support them in carousel posts anyway).
- Caption should be 100-200 words with a CTA: "Save this. Share with someone who needs it."

### 6. Instagram Reels Script

Reels are TikTok's cousin but the audience skews slightly older and more polished. Same script format, different tone.
