# The 1 Article → 8 Platforms Workflow

### Step 0: Extract the Atoms

Before writing anything, dissect the source into atomic units:

1. **The Core Thesis** (1 sentence, under 15 words)
2. **The Hook** (the single most surprising/contrarian claim)
3. **3-7 Standalone Insights** (each must be interesting without context)
4. **Key Data Points** (specific numbers, percentages, dollar amounts)
5. **Personal Story Beats** (concrete moments: time, place, what happened)
6. **The "Wait, What?" Moment** (the thing that makes people stop scrolling)
7. **Visual Proof** (screenshots, charts, before/after data worth showing)
8. **The Actionable Takeaway** (what should the reader DO differently?)

Write these down. Every platform piece pulls from this list. Nothing gets invented from thin air.

### Step 1: Prioritize Platforms

Not every article works everywhere. Pick platforms based on content type AND where your audience actually is.

#### Content-Type → Platform Map

| Source Content Type | Best Platforms (in order) | Skip |
|---|---|---|
| **Data/research heavy** (numbers, charts, analysis) | X thread → LinkedIn → IG carousel → Substack excerpt | TikTok (unless you can visualize the data), YouTube Shorts |
| **Personal story / build-in-public** | X thread → TikTok → LinkedIn → Threads → IG Reels | IG carousel (stories don't slide well) |
| **How-to / tutorial** | TikTok → YouTube Shorts → IG carousel → X thread → LinkedIn | Threads (too instructional for the vibe) |
| **Contrarian take / hot take** | X thread → Threads → LinkedIn → TikTok | IG carousel (takes don't need 10 slides) |
| **Product launch / feature demo** | TikTok → IG Reels → YouTube Shorts → X thread → LinkedIn | Substack (save for bigger narratives) |
| **Framework / mental model** | IG carousel → LinkedIn → X thread → Substack excerpt | TikTok (frameworks are hard in 60 seconds) |

#### Bloom Audience Priority Order

1. **X/Twitter** (highest current engagement, builder/investor audience)
2. **LinkedIn** (PM/founder crossover audience, strong for Bloom's B2B-adjacent story)
3. **TikTok** (Gen Z investing audience, growth channel via ReelFarm)
4. **Instagram** (carousels for evergreen education, Reels for hooks)
5. **Threads** (low effort, high optionality, Meta's algorithm pushes new content)
6. **YouTube Shorts** (repurpose TikTok scripts, long-tail discovery)
7. **Substack** (newsletter excerpt to drive subscriptions back to long-form)

Hit platforms 1-3 same day. Platforms 4-6 within 48 hours. Platform 7 in the next newsletter.
