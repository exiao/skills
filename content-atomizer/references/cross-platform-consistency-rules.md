# Cross-Platform Consistency Rules

Every platform piece must be genuinely native, but they all share:

1. **Same core thesis.** Don't invent new arguments per platform. Remix the same insight.
2. **Same voice.** Read `~/marketing/WRITING-STYLE.md`. Punchy, concrete, specific numbers, build-in-public energy. No corporate speak on any platform.
3. **Same data points.** Use the ACTUAL numbers from the article. Don't round $405.23 to "about $400."
4. **Different entry points.** TikTok enters through emotion. X enters through surprise. LinkedIn enters through professional relevance. IG enters through visual impact. Same destination, different doors.
5. **No copy-paste across platforms.** If your LinkedIn post is just your X thread with more characters, you've failed. Rewrite for each platform's native format, reading pattern, and audience expectation.
6. **Time the drops.** Don't blast all 8 platforms simultaneously. Stagger: X thread first (primes discussion), LinkedIn same day (different audience), TikTok/Reels within 24h (production time), Threads/Shorts within 48h, Substack in next newsletter.
