# Threads: [topic]

### Option A: Hot Take (single post)
[1-3 sentences. Conversational. Opinionated. No links. Under 500 chars.]

### Option B: Mini-Thread (2-4 posts)
**Post 1:** [Hook - the surprising claim, under 200 chars]
**Post 2:** [The context - why this matters]
**Post 3:** [The proof - specific number or example]
**Post 4:** [The takeaway or question]
```

**Rules:**
- Write like you're texting a smart friend. Threads rewards casual > polished.
- No links. No images (unless genuinely compelling). Text-first platform.
- Contrarian takes and observations perform best. How-tos underperform.
- Under 500 characters for single posts. Threads' "see more" fold is brutal.
- Post between 7-9 AM or 6-8 PM EST. Threads' audience is in browsing mode during commute hours.
- Don't cross-post your exact X thread. Write fresh for the platform. Different audience, different vibe.
- Ask questions. Threads rewards replies more than likes.

**Example:**
```
The entire energy sector is worth less than Apple.

One company that makes phones vs the industry that powers every building, vehicle, and factory on the planet.

Either energy is the most undervalued sector in 50 years, or we've collectively decided it doesn't matter.

Which is it?
