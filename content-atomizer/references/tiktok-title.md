**On-screen action:** [point to follow button / show app download]

### CAPTION
[caption text with hashtags, under 150 chars]

### ENGAGEMENT HOOKS (pick 1-2)
- [ ] Don't mention app name (force "what app is this?" comments)
- [ ] Intentional math bait (slightly wrong number to trigger corrections)
- [ ] "Which type are you?" (self-categorization)
- [ ] Show result first, explain after
- [ ] End on a cliffhanger for part 2
```

**TikTok Hook Selection (use `headlines` skill, TikTok section):**

Pick from these Tier 1 formulas:
1. "The exact moment I [unexpected realization]..."
2. "I [did X] for [time period]. Here's what happened."
3. "Stop [common action] right now."
4. "Nobody talks about [specific thing]."
5. Show result first, then explain (visual hook, no words needed for first second).

**Rules:**
- Hook must land in under 3 seconds. If the viewer doesn't feel something in 3 seconds, they swipe.
- Text overlay and spoken words should be DIFFERENT. Text = the hook. Voice = the context. This doubles retention.
- First frame must be visually interesting. No person sitting at a desk. No blank screen.
- Never start with "Hey guys", "So today", "In this video". Instant swipe.
- Spoken words should be conversational, not scripted-sounding. Read it aloud. If you stumble, rewrite.
- 30-60 second target. Under 30 feels rushed. Over 60 loses the algorithm.
- Specify engagement hooks from the SGE playbook in the headlines skill.
