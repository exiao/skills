# Quality Checklist (Run Before Saving)

For each platform piece, verify:

- [ ] **Hook test:** Would you stop scrolling for the first line/frame? Be honest.
- [ ] **Platform-native test:** Could this ONLY live on this platform? If you could copy-paste it to another platform unchanged, it's not native enough.
- [ ] **Specificity test:** Are there real numbers? ("363 tests" not "many tests", "$2.4B" not "billions")
- [ ] **Voice test:** Read `~/marketing/WRITING-STYLE.md`. Does this sound like Eric talking to a friend? Not a brand, not a textbook, not a hype machine.
- [ ] **Standalone test:** If someone sees ONLY this piece (never the article), is it still valuable?
- [ ] **Kill phrase check:** No "game-changer", no "let's dive in", no em dashes, no "every X is Y, this one isn't." See WRITING-STYLE.md kill phrases list.
- [ ] **Length check:** Is it within the platform's sweet spot? (X: under 280/post, LinkedIn: 1200-1500 chars, TikTok: 30-60s, IG carousel: 8-10 slides at 40 words max per slide, Threads: under 500 chars)
- [ ] **CTA check:** Does each piece have a clear next action? (follow, save, subscribe, link in bio, read the full thing)
