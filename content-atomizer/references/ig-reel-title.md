**Differences from TikTok:**
- Slightly more polished/professional tone (less chaotic energy, more "smart friend explains")
- 15-30 seconds performs better on Reels than 60 seconds
- Educational content outperforms entertainment on IG Reels (flip of TikTok)
- Trending audio matters more on Reels than on TikTok
- CTA should push saves and shares, not follows (saves = algorithmic gold on IG)
