### Summary for campaign setup

**Campaign name:** Bloom — AI Investing UGC

**Brand description:**
Bloom is the best AI for investing in stocks. It researches stocks and helps you invest smarter. 100K+ downloads. Targeting TikTok/Reels finance creators.

**Content type:** UGC (original short-form videos, not clipping)

**Platforms:** TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts

**CPM:** $2 per 1,000 views

**Content guidelines (paste into brief field):**
```
Make short, engaging finance/investing videos. DO NOT hard sell — make it feel like native FYP content. Mention Bloom subtly (screenshots of the app, casual references) or not at all. No hard selling. No explicit performance/return claims.

Good hooks to use:
- "i showed bloom my robinhood portfolio…it ROASTED me"
- "i gave bloom 10k to invest"
- "Before I do something dumb on robinhood…"
- "You're picking stocks wrong"
- "Did you know you can use AI to analyze 20 stocks in the time it takes to make a coffee?"
- "Your financial advisor won't tell you this"
- "hedge funds are buying these 5 stocks"

Posting tips:
- Post 1-2x/day. Use a fresh account named like investingwithsarah or moneywithjake.
- Warm up account first (watch finance content, search keywords).
- Use trending sounds. Engage with FYP 10 min before/after posting.

What Bloom does: AI investing research that helps retail investors catch red flags, audit portfolios, stress-test trades, and know what's moving their stocks.

Target audience: newer investors, millennials/gen-z with brokerage accounts, Robinhood users, anyone anxious about their portfolio.
