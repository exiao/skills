# Calendar Batching

Consistency is the skill. Inspiration is not a system.

## The Rule

Never create one post and call it done. Batch-generate at least 7 days of content per session. Fill the queue before closing the session.

A single post is a test. A queue is a system.

## Workflow

1. **Research first** — check monetization-research.md and competitor-research.md before planning content
2. **Generate in bulk** — use tweet-ideas, content-atomizer, or slideshow-creator to produce the full week at once
3. **Schedule back-to-back** — use `--schedule next-free-slot` (Typefully) or ReelFarm automations to fill the calendar
4. **Verify** — check `drafts:list --status scheduled --sort scheduled_date` to confirm queue depth
5. **Set a refill trigger** — if queue drops below 3 days, refill immediately (not "when you have time")

## Queue Minimums by Platform

| Platform | Min queue | Cadence | Tool |
|----------|-----------|---------|------|
| LinkedIn | 7 posts | 1/day | Typefully |
| X | 14 posts | 2/day | Typefully |
| TikTok | 14–21 posts | 2–3/day | ReelFarm |
| Threads | 7 posts | 1/day | Typefully |

## Posting Windows (Adjust for Audience Timezone)

| Time | Audience moment |
|------|-----------------|
| 7:30 AM | Early scrollers, morning commute |
| 4:30 PM | Afternoon break |
| 9:00 PM | Evening wind-down |

For TikTok: test all three windows for the first 2 weeks, then concentrate on whichever shows best average views.

## Drip Strategy for Topic-Based Content

When building topical authority (e.g., launching around an article or campaign):

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Day -1 to Day 0 | 3–4 warm-up posts (no link, pure topical takes) |
| Day 0 (publish) | 2–3 posts + article/thread link |
| Day 1–3 | 3–4 follow-up posts keeping the topic alive |
| Ongoing | Recycle top performers when news hits the same topic |

## Multi-Account Batching

When running 5–10 accounts (see monetization-research.md), batch content per account in a single session:
- Generate one creative set (3–5 image variations)
- Schedule the same content across accounts with different captions/text overlays
- Stagger by 30–60 minutes per account to avoid platform detection of duplicate activity

## Signs the System Is Breaking Down

- You're manually deciding what to post each day → batch mode is off
- Queue depth < 3 days → refill now
- Posting frequency is inconsistent week-over-week → automation isn't set up
- You're posting the same content across accounts simultaneously → stagger it
