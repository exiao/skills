# Documents Skill

Covers all office document formats. Based on the task, read the appropriate sub-file for complete instructions.

## Routing

| Task | Sub-file |
|------|----------|
| Create, read, or edit Word `.docx` files (tracked changes, XML editing, tables, styles) | Read `docx.md` |
| Read, merge, split, watermark, fill forms, OCR, or create PDF files | Read `pdf.md` |
| Create or edit PowerPoint `.pptx` slide decks | Read `pptx.md` |
| Create, read, or edit Excel `.xlsx` spreadsheets | Read `xlsx.md` |

**Always read the full sub-file for the relevant format before starting work.** Each sub-file contains critical rules, workflows, and gotchas that are easy to get wrong.
