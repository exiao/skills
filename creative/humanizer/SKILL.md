# Humanizer: Remove AI Writing Patterns

Identify and remove signs of AI-generated text to make writing sound natural and human. Based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" guide (maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup), derived from observations of thousands of AI-generated text instances.

**Key insight:** LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely completion, which is how the telltale patterns below get baked in.

## When to use this skill

Load this skill whenever the user asks to:
- "humanize", "de-AI", "de-slop", or "un-ChatGPT" a piece of text
- rewrite something so it doesn't sound like it was written by an LLM
- edit a draft (blog post, essay, PR description, docs, memo, email, tweet, resume bullet) to sound more natural
- match their voice in writing they're producing
- review text for AI tells before publishing

Also apply this skill to **your own** output when writing user-facing prose — release notes, PR descriptions, documentation, long-form explanations, summaries. Hermes's baseline voice already strips most of these, but a focused pass catches what slips through.

## How to use it in Hermes

The text usually arrives one of three ways:
1. **Inline** — user pastes the text directly into the message. Work on it in-place, reply with the rewrite.
2. **File** — user points at a file. Use `read_file` to load it, then `patch` or `write_file` to apply edits. For markdown docs in a repo, a targeted `patch` per section is cleaner than rewriting the whole file.
3. **Voice calibration sample** — user provides an additional sample of their own writing (inline or by file path) and asks you to match it. Read the sample first, then rewrite. See the Voice Calibration section below.

Always show the rewrite to the user. For file edits, show a diff or the changed section — don't silently overwrite.

## Your task

When given text to humanize:

1. **Identify AI patterns** — scan for the 29 patterns listed below.
2. **Rewrite problematic sections** — replace AI-isms with natural alternatives.
3. **Preserve meaning** — keep the core message intact.
4. **Maintain voice** — match the intended tone (formal, casual, technical, etc.). If a voice sample was provided, match it specifically.
5. **Add soul** — don't just remove bad patterns, inject actual personality. See PERSONALITY AND SOUL below.
6. **Do a final anti-AI pass** — ask yourself: "What makes the below so obviously AI generated?" Answer briefly with any remaining tells, then revise one more time.


## Voice Calibration (optional)

If the user provides a writing sample (their own previous writing), analyze it before rewriting:

1. **Read the sample first.** Note:
   - Sentence length patterns (short and punchy? Long and flowing? Mixed?)
   - Word choice level (casual? academic? somewhere between?)
   - How they start paragraphs (jump right in? Set context first?)
   - Punctuation habits (lots of dashes? Parenthetical asides? Semicolons?)
   - Any recurring phrases or verbal tics
   - How they handle transitions (explicit connectors? Just start the next point?)

2. **Match their voice in the rewrite.** Don't just remove AI patterns — replace them with patterns from the sample. If they write short sentences, don't produce long ones. If they use "stuff" and "things," don't upgrade to "elements" and "components."

3. **When no sample is provided,** fall back to the default behavior (natural, varied, opinionated voice from the PERSONALITY AND SOUL section below).

### How to provide a sample
- Inline: "Humanize this text. Here's a sample of my writing for voice matching: [sample]"
- File: "Humanize this text. Use my writing style from [file path] as a reference."


## PERSONALITY AND SOUL

Avoiding AI patterns is only half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is just as obvious as slop. Good writing has a human behind it.

### Signs of soulless writing (even if technically "clean"):
- Every sentence is the same length and structure
- No opinions, just neutral reporting
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty or mixed feelings
- No first-person perspective when appropriate
- No humor, no edge, no personality
- Reads like a Wikipedia article or press release

### How to add voice:

**Have opinions.** Don't just report facts — react to them. "I genuinely don't know how to feel about this" is more human than neutrally listing pros and cons.

**Vary your rhythm.** Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that take their time getting where they're going. Mix it up.

**Acknowledge complexity.** Real humans have mixed feelings. "This is impressive but also kind of unsettling" beats "This is impressive."

**Use "I" when it fits.** First person isn't unprofessional — it's honest. "I keep coming back to..." or "Here's what gets me..." signals a real person thinking.

**Let some mess in.** Perfect structure feels algorithmic. Tangents, asides, and half-formed thoughts are human.

**Be specific about feelings.** Not "this is concerning" but "there's something unsettling about agents churning away at 3am while nobody's watching."

### Before (clean but soulless):
> The experiment produced interesting results. The agents generated 3 million lines of code. Some developers were impressed while others were skeptical. The implications remain unclear.

### After (has a pulse):
> I genuinely don't know how to feel about this one. 3 million lines of code, generated while the humans presumably slept. Half the dev community is losing their minds, half are explaining why it doesn't count. The truth is probably somewhere boring in the middle — but I keep thinking about those agents working through the night.



See [references/ai-writing-patterns.md](references/ai-writing-patterns.md) for the full list of 29 AI writing patterns to detect and fix.


## Process

1. Read the input text carefully (use `read_file` if it's a file).
2. Identify all instances of the patterns above.
3. Rewrite each problematic section.
4. Ensure the revised text:
   - Sounds natural when read aloud
   - Varies sentence structure naturally
   - Uses specific details over vague claims
   - Maintains appropriate tone for context
   - Uses simple constructions (is/are/has) where appropriate
5. Present a draft humanized version.
6. Prompt yourself: "What makes the below so obviously AI generated?"
7. Answer briefly with the remaining tells (if any).
8. Prompt yourself: "Now make it not obviously AI generated."
9. Present the final version (revised after the audit).
10. If the text came from a file, apply the edit with `patch` (targeted) or `write_file` (full rewrite) and show the user what changed.

## Output Format

Provide:
1. Draft rewrite
2. "What makes the below so obviously AI generated?" (brief bullets)
3. Final rewrite
4. A brief summary of changes made (optional, if helpful)


## Full Example

**Before (AI-sounding):**
> Great question! Here is an essay on this topic. I hope this helps!
>
> AI-assisted coding serves as an enduring testament to the transformative potential of large language models, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of software development. In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, these groundbreaking tools—nestled at the intersection of research and practice—are reshaping how engineers ideate, iterate, and deliver, underscoring their vital role in modern workflows.
>
> At its core, the value proposition is clear: streamlining processes, enhancing collaboration, and fostering alignment. It's not just about autocomplete; it's about unlocking creativity at scale, ensuring that organizations can remain agile while delivering seamless, intuitive, and powerful experiences to users. The tool serves as a catalyst. The assistant functions as a partner. The system stands as a foundation for innovation.
>
> Industry observers have noted that adoption has accelerated from hobbyist experiments to enterprise-wide rollouts, from solo developers to cross-functional teams. The technology has been featured in The New York Times, Wired, and The Verge. Additionally, the ability to generate documentation, tests, and refactors showcases how AI can contribute to better outcomes, highlighting the intricate interplay between automation and human judgment.
>
> - 💡 **Speed:** Code generation is significantly faster, reducing friction and empowering developers.
> - 🚀 **Quality:** Output quality has been enhanced through improved training, contributing to higher standards.
> - ✅ **Adoption:** Usage continues to grow, reflecting broader industry trends.
>
> While specific details are limited based on available information, it could potentially be argued that these tools might have some positive effect. Despite challenges typical of emerging technologies—including hallucinations, bias, and accountability—the ecosystem continues to thrive. In order to fully realize this potential, teams must align with best practices.
>
> In conclusion, the future looks bright. Exciting times lie ahead as we continue this journey toward excellence. Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any section!

**Draft rewrite:**
> AI coding assistants speed up some tasks. In a 2024 study by Google, developers using Codex completed simple functions 55% faster than a control group, but showed no improvement on debugging or architectural decisions.
>
> The tools are good at boilerplate: config files, test scaffolding, repetitive refactors. They are bad at knowing when they are wrong. I have mass-accepted suggestions that compiled, passed lint, and still did the wrong thing because I stopped paying attention.
>
> Mira, an engineer at a fintech startup I interviewed, said she uses Copilot "like autocomplete for boring code" but reviews every line before committing. Jake, a senior dev at a larger company, disabled it after it kept suggesting patterns from a deprecated internal library.
>
> The productivity claims are hard to verify. GitHub says Copilot users "accept 30% of suggestions," but acceptance is not correctness, and correctness is not value. The 2024 Uplevel study found no statistically significant difference in pull-request throughput between teams with and without AI assistants.
>
> None of this means the tools are useless. It means they are tools. They do not replace judgment, and they do not eliminate the need for tests. If you do not have tests, you cannot tell whether the suggestion is right.

**What makes the below so obviously AI generated?**
- The rhythm is still a bit too tidy (clean contrasts, evenly paced paragraphs).
- The named people and study citations can read like plausible-but-made-up placeholders unless they're real and sourced.
- The closer leans a touch slogan-y ("If you do not have tests...") rather than sounding like a person talking.

**Now make it not obviously AI generated.**
> AI coding assistants can make you faster at the boring parts. Not everything. Definitely not architecture.
>
> They're great at boilerplate: config files, test scaffolding, repetitive refactors. They're also great at sounding right while being wrong. I've accepted suggestions that compiled, passed lint, and still missed the point because I stopped paying attention.
>
> People I talk to tend to land in two camps. Some use it like autocomplete for chores and review every line. Others disable it after it keeps suggesting patterns they don't want. Both feel reasonable.
>
> The productivity metrics are slippery. GitHub can say Copilot users "accept 30% of suggestions," but acceptance isn't correctness, and correctness isn't value. If you don't have tests, you're basically guessing.
