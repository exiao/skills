# Superpowers Planning

Covers three tightly related planning workflows. Based on the task, read the appropriate sub-file for complete instructions.

## Routing

| Task | Sub-file |
|------|----------|
| Establishing which skills to use, skill invocation discipline, avoiding skill-skipping rationalizations | Read `using-superpowers.md` |
| Exploring requirements, brainstorming designs, getting user approval before implementation | Read `brainstorming.md` |
| Writing detailed multi-step implementation plans with exact file paths, code, and test steps | Read `writing-plans.md` |

## Typical Flow

**Explore → Design → Plan → Execute**

1. New feature or idea → `brainstorming.md` first
2. Brainstorming will invoke `writing-plans.md` when design is approved
3. Plans will invoke `superpowers-coding` (subagent-driven-development or executing-plans) for execution
4. At any point, if unsure whether a skill applies → `using-superpowers.md`

**Always read the full sub-file** — each contains hard rules, checklists, and process gates that are easy to skip accidentally.
