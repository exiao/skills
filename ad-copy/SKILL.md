# Direct Response Copy

Copy that converts. Not content that entertains.

**The distinction matters.** Content marketing builds audience over time (blog posts, newsletters, thought leadership). Direct response gets someone to take a specific action RIGHT NOW (download the app, start a free trial, subscribe, buy). Every word either moves toward the conversion or it's dead weight. Cut it.
