# 6. Email Sequences

Email is the workhorse of conversion. Not for newsletters (that's content marketing). These are action-driving sequences tied to specific user lifecycle stages.

### Email Anti-Patterns

- ❌ "Dear Valued Customer" (use their name or nothing)
- ❌ Emails longer than 200 words (mobile readers, max 150 is better)
- ❌ Multiple CTAs in one email (one email, one action)
- ❌ HTML-heavy templates that look like ads (plain text converts better for lifecycle emails)
- ❌ Sending the same email to all users regardless of behavior
- ❌ "Unsubscribe to stop receiving these" buried in 6pt font (make it easy and honest)
- ❌ Subject lines that don't relate to body content (bait-and-switch kills trust)
