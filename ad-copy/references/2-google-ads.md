# 2. Google Ads

Every character costs money. Literally. Bad copy = higher CPC, lower quality score, wasted budget.

### Responsive Search Ads (RSA)

Google tests combinations of your headlines and descriptions. Give it good ingredients.

#### Headlines (30 characters each, up to 15)

Write headlines in tiers:

**Tier 1: Benefit headlines (write 5)**
```
Research Stocks in Seconds      (26)
AI Stock Research App           (21)
Free Stock Analysis Tool        (24)
See Why Stocks Move             (19)
Never Miss an Upgrade           (22)
```

**Tier 2: Proof/trust headlines (write 3)**
```

**Rules:**
- Pin your strongest benefit headline to Position 1
- Pin your strongest CTA to Position 3
- Let Google test the rest
- No two headlines should say the same thing differently
- Include the primary keyword in at least 3 headlines
- Use Title Case (Google standard)

#### Descriptions (90 characters each, up to 4)

```
Description 1 (benefit + proof):
"Research any stock in 30 seconds. AI-powered analysis used by 52,000+ investors."  (82)

Description 2 (how it works):
"Get analyst ratings, insider trades, and earnings breakdowns. All in one free app." (83)

Description 3 (risk reversal):
"Free to download. No credit card. Cancel premium anytime. Start in under a minute." (84)

Description 4 (differentiator):
"Unlike screeners, Bloom explains what the data means. AI reads filings for you."    (81)
```

**Rules:**
- Description 1 should work alone (it's shown most often)
- Include a CTA in at least one description
- Include social proof in at least one description
- Don't repeat headline copy in descriptions

### Google Ads Quality Score Rules

Quality Score directly affects your CPC. Higher score = lower cost per click.

1. **Ad relevance**: Headlines must contain the keyword the ad group targets
2. **Landing page experience**: The page must deliver on the ad's promise
3. **Expected CTR**: Specific, benefit-driven copy gets more clicks

**The #1 mistake:** Writing one ad that targets every keyword. Write ad groups around tight keyword themes. "AI stock research" ads and "analyst rating alerts" ads need different copy.
