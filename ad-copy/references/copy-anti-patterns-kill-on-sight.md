# Copy Anti-Patterns (Kill on Sight)

These patterns kill conversions. If you see them in any draft, rewrite immediately.

### Feature Listing Without Benefits
```
❌ "AI-powered analysis, real-time data, watchlists, alerts, screeners"
✅ "Research any stock in 30 seconds. AI reads the filings so you don't have to."
```
Features are ingredients. Benefits are the meal. Nobody orders "flour, eggs, sugar." They order cake.

### Being Clever Instead of Clear
```
❌ "Where alpha meets artificial intelligence"
✅ "AI stock research. Search any stock, get the full picture."
```
Clever copy makes the writer feel smart. Clear copy makes the reader take action. Every time you're tempted to be clever, ask: "Would my mom understand what this app does from this sentence?"

### Burying the CTA
```
❌ [500 words of features] ... [CTA at very bottom]
✅ [Headline] → [CTA] → [Supporting evidence] → [CTA again]
```
Put the CTA within the first scroll. Then repeat it after every major section. Some people decide fast. Let them.

### Weak CTAs
```
❌ "Learn More"          → learn more about WHAT?
❌ "Get Started"         → started with WHAT?
❌ "Click Here"          → nobody says "click here" in 2026
❌ "Submit"              → sounds like surrendering
❌ "Sign Up"             → sounds like homework

✅ "Download Bloom Free"  → specific action + product + risk reversal
✅ "Start Investing Smarter" → benefit-driven
✅ "Research Your First Stock" → specific, immediate value
✅ "Get the App — It's Free" → action + risk reversal
```

### No Social Proof
If your landing page / ad / listing doesn't include at least ONE of these, it's incomplete:
- User count ("52,000 investors")
- Star rating ("4.8★ from 2,400+ reviews")
- Specific user result ("Found a 40% undervalued stock")
- Press mention ("Featured in TechCrunch")

### Vague Value Props
```
❌ "Powerful tools for smart investing"    → what tools? how powerful?
❌ "Take control of your financial future" → means nothing specific
❌ "Invest with confidence"                → cliché, no specifics
❌ "Your all-in-one investing solution"    → every app says this

✅ "AI reads 10-K filings so you don't have to"  → specific, tangible
✅ "See analyst rating changes before the market opens" → specific timing
✅ "Search 6,000+ stocks. Get a breakdown in 30 seconds." → specific scope + speed
```

### The "We" Problem
```
❌ "We built Bloom to help investors research smarter"
✅ "Research any stock in 30 seconds"
```
The reader doesn't care about you. They care about what they get. Lead with "you" and the benefit, not "we" and the origin story.
