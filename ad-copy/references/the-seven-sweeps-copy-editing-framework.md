# The Seven Sweeps (Copy Editing Framework)

After drafting any copy, run these seven sequential editing passes. Each focuses on one dimension.

1. **Clarity**: Can the reader understand what you're saying? Cut confusing sentences, unclear pronouns, jargon, ambiguity.
2. **Voice & Tone**: Consistent brand voice throughout? Check for shifts between casual and corporate. Read aloud for inconsistencies.
3. **So What**: Does every claim answer "why should I care?" For every feature statement, add the "which means..." bridge to a benefit.
4. **Prove It**: Is every claim supported? Flag unsubstantiated assertions. Add testimonials, stats, case studies, or soften the claim.
5. **Specificity**: Replace vague with concrete. "Save time" → "Save 4 hours every week." "Many customers" → "2,847 teams." Remove anything that can't be made specific (it's filler).
6. **Heightened Emotion**: Does the copy make the reader feel something? Paint the "before" state vividly. Reference shared experiences.
7. **Zero Risk**: Have we removed every barrier to action? Address objections near CTAs. Add trust signals, guarantees, clear next steps.

After each sweep, loop back to verify previous sweeps aren't compromised. The process is iterative.

### Quick Word-Level Fixes
**Cut:** very, really, extremely, just, actually, basically, "in order to"
**Replace:** utilize → use, implement → set up, leverage → use, facilitate → help, innovative → new, robust → strong, seamless → smooth
