# Process: Writing Copy with This Skill

1. **Identify the format** (App Store, Google Ad, landing page, TikTok script, push, email)
2. **Read WRITING-STYLE.md** for tone calibration
3. **Identify the audience awareness level** (unaware, problem-aware, solution-aware)
4. **Pick the framework** (AIDA for most ads, PAS for pain-heavy audiences, Offer Stack for pricing pages)
5. **Write to the character limits** (reference the table above, write to fit)
6. **Apply the anti-pattern checklist** (feature listing? weak CTA? no social proof? fix it)
7. **Include social proof** (never ship copy without at least one proof element)
8. **Write 3 variants** for A/B testing (different hooks, same structure)
9. **Check against WRITING-STYLE.md** one more time (does it sound like Eric? Would he say this to a friend?)
