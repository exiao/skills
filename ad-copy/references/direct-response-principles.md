# Direct Response Principles

These are not suggestions. They're the physics of conversion copy.

### AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)

Every piece of copy follows this arc. The mistake is spending 80% on Attention and 5% on Action.

| Stage | Job | Example (Bloom) |
|-------|-----|-----------------|
| **Attention** | Stop the scroll. Pattern interrupt. | "Your portfolio dropped 4% today. Do you know why?" |
| **Interest** | Connect to their problem. Be specific. | "Most investors find out what moved their stocks 3 days late. From a CNBC headline." |
| **Desire** | Show the outcome. Make it tangible. | "Bloom gives you the exact catalyst, analyst rating changes, and insider trades. In real time." |
| **Action** | Tell them exactly what to do. One action. | "Download free. See your first stock breakdown in 60 seconds." |

### PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solve)

More aggressive than AIDA. Best for audiences that know they have a problem but haven't solved it yet.

- **Problem**: Name it. Specifically. "You're checking 4 apps and 6 tabs to research one stock."
- **Agitate**: Make the pain vivid. "By the time you piece it all together, the move already happened. You're always a day late."
- **Solve**: Position your product as the obvious fix. "Bloom pulls everything into one screen. Analyst ratings, insider trades, earnings, catalysts. Research a stock in 30 seconds, not 30 minutes."

### The Offer Stack

What you get + bonuses + guarantee + urgency = irresistible offer.

```
WHAT YOU GET:
✓ AI-powered stock research (covers 6,000+ tickers)
✓ Real-time analyst rating changes
✓ Insider trading alerts
✓ Earnings breakdowns before and after

BONUS:
✓ Watchlist with smart alerts (free tier)
✓ AI chat that actually cites sources

GUARANTEE:
✓ Free to download. No credit card. Cancel anytime.

URGENCY:
✓ "Premium is 50% off for the first 1,000 users this month"
```

Even for a free app download, stack the value. List everything they get. Make free feel like a steal.

### Risk Reversal

Remove every reason NOT to act.
- "Free to download" → removes cost objection
- "No credit card required" → removes commitment fear
- "Cancel anytime" → removes lock-in anxiety
- "Takes 30 seconds to set up" → removes time objection
- "Used by 50,000+ investors" → removes "is this legit?" doubt

### Urgency and Scarcity

Only use when real. Fake urgency destroys trust.

- ✅ "Premium is 50% off through January" (real deadline)
- ✅ "Limited to first 1,000 users" (real cap)
- ✅ "Earnings season starts Monday. Set up alerts now." (real event)
- ❌ "Limited time offer!" (meaningless)
- ❌ "Don't miss out!" (says nothing)
- ❌ Countdown timers that reset on page refresh (fraud)

### Specificity Sells

The specific is more believable than the general. Always.

| ❌ Generic | ✅ Specific |
|-----------|------------|
| "Powerful stock research" | "Research any stock in 30 seconds" |
| "AI-powered insights" | "AI that reads 10-K filings so you don't have to" |
| "Stay informed" | "Get alerts when analysts upgrade your stocks" |
| "Trusted by thousands" | "Used by 52,000 investors" |
| "Save time" | "Replace 6 tabs with 1 screen" |

### Social Proof

Types ranked by conversion impact:
1. **Specific numbers**: "52,000 investors use Bloom" > "thousands of users"
2. **Star ratings**: "4.8★ on the App Store (2,400+ ratings)"
3. **User quotes with specifics**: "I found a 40% undervalued stock in my first week" > "Great app!"
4. **Authority**: "Featured in TechCrunch, Product Hunt #1"
5. **Velocity**: "1,000 new users last week" (momentum > total)
