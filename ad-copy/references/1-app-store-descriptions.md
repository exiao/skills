# 1. App Store Descriptions

App Store copy is the highest-leverage copy you can write. Every ad, every link, every mention ultimately drives to this page. If the listing doesn't convert, everything upstream is wasted.

### iOS App Store

#### App Name (30 characters)

The name is your #1 ranking factor and your #1 brand signal. Use it wisely.

**Formula**: `[Brand Name]: [Core Value Prop]` or `[Brand Name] - [Key Benefit]`

```
✅ Bloom: Stock Research & AI      (28 chars)
✅ Bloom - AI Investing Research    (30 chars)
✅ Bloom: AI Stock Analysis         (25 chars)

❌ Bloom                            (wastes keyword space)
❌ Bloom - The Best AI-Powered...   (truncated, looks broken)
❌ Bloom Investing Research AI App  (keyword stuffing)
```

**Finance/investing app examples that convert:**
- `Robinhood: Investing for All` (28 chars)
- `Webull: Investing & Trading` (27 chars)
- `Seeking Alpha: Stock Market` (27 chars)
- `Morningstar: Investing` (22 chars)

#### Subtitle (30 characters)

Reinforces the name with a benefit. Not a feature restatement.

```
✅ Research Stocks in Seconds      (27 chars)  ← benefit + speed
✅ Smarter Stock Research           (23 chars)  ← benefit
✅ AI-Powered Stock Analysis        (26 chars)  ← method + what

❌ Trading & Investing App          (generic, no benefit)
❌ Best Stock Market App            (claim without proof)
❌ For Investors & Traders          (audience, not benefit)
```

#### Keyword Field (100 characters)

Comma-separated. No spaces after commas. Don't repeat words from your name or subtitle (Apple already indexes those).

```
stocks,investing,portfolio,trading,analyst,ratings,earnings,research,
finance,market,AI,screener,alerts,dividends,options
```

**Rules:**
- Don't waste characters on your app name or competitor names (against guidelines)
- Singular > plural (Apple matches both)
- No spaces after commas (wastes characters)
- Test different keyword combos monthly using Appfigures/App Annie rank tracking
- Prioritize high-volume, medium-competition keywords

#### Description (4,000 characters)

Only the first 3 lines (~90 characters) are visible before "more." These 3 lines are your entire pitch for 80% of viewers.

**Structure:**

```
LINE 1-3 (above the fold — this is everything):
[Benefit-driven hook that makes them tap "more"]

"Research any stock in 30 seconds. Bloom uses AI to break down analyst
ratings, insider trades, earnings, and catalysts — so you make smarter
investment decisions without spending hours reading filings."

REST OF DESCRIPTION:

WHY INVESTORS CHOOSE BLOOM
• AI stock research covering 6,000+ tickers
• Real-time analyst rating changes and price targets
• Insider trading alerts (see what executives are buying)
• Earnings breakdowns with AI-generated summaries
• Smart watchlist with custom alerts

HOW IT WORKS
1. Search any stock or add it to your watchlist
2. Get an instant AI breakdown: bull case, bear case, key metrics
3. Receive alerts when something changes (analyst upgrade, insider buy, earnings beat)

WHAT MAKES BLOOM DIFFERENT
Unlike stock screeners that give you raw data, Bloom explains what the data means. Our AI reads 10-K filings, earnings transcripts, and analyst reports — then gives you the insight in plain English.

"I found a 40% undervalued stock in my first week using Bloom."

```

**Rules:**
- First 3 lines must stand alone as a complete pitch
- Use line breaks aggressively. Walls of text don't get read.
- Bullet points > paragraphs for features
- One user quote with stars. Specificity > effusiveness.
- End with a CTA. "Download Bloom" not "We hope you enjoy our app!"
- Don't use the description for keyword stuffing. iOS doesn't index it.
- Update quarterly. Test different above-fold hooks.

#### What's New (4,000 characters)

Most apps waste this with "bug fixes and performance improvements." That's a missed conversion opportunity.

```
✅ GOOD:
NEW: AI earnings analysis
Bloom now breaks down earnings reports in real-time. Get the bull case, bear 
case, and key surprises within minutes of the announcement.

Also in this update:
• Faster stock search (2x improvement)
• New insider trading alerts
• Fixed notification delivery on iOS 18

❌ BAD:
Bug fixes and performance improvements.
```

**Rules:**
- Lead with the most exciting new feature
- Name the specific benefit, not just the feature name
- Include 2-3 smaller improvements as bullets
- This appears on the update screen. It's a re-engagement opportunity.

#### Screenshot Text

Screenshots are your most powerful conversion tool. First 3 are visible in search results.

**Rules:**
- Screenshot 1 = your best pitch (most people only see this one)
- Text on screenshots should be benefits, not feature names
- Max 5-7 words per screenshot overlay
- Show real app UI, not mockups

```
Screenshot 1: "Research Any Stock in 30 Seconds"
Screenshot 2: "AI Reads the Filings. You Get the Insight."
Screenshot 3: "Real-Time Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades"
Screenshot 4: "See What Insiders Are Buying"
Screenshot 5: "Earnings Breakdowns in Plain English"
Screenshot 6: "Smart Alerts. Never Miss a Move."
```

**Anti-patterns:**
- ❌ "Powerful AI Technology" (means nothing)
- ❌ "Beautiful Interface" (obvious/subjective)
- ❌ "Feature 1, Feature 2, Feature 3" (list dump)
- ❌ Microscopic text that's unreadable on phone screens

### Google Play Store

Google Play's description IS indexed for search. This changes everything.

#### Short Description (80 characters)

This is your App Store subtitle equivalent but with nearly 3x the space. Use it.

```
✅ AI stock research: analyst ratings, insider trades, earnings. All in one app. (79 chars)
✅ Research any stock in 30 seconds with AI. Free to download.                   (65 chars)

❌ The best investing app for stock market research                               (generic)
❌ Bloom is an AI-powered investing research platform                             (feature, not benefit)
```

#### Full Description (4,000 characters)

Unlike iOS, Google Play DOES index the description for keyword ranking. Weave in keywords naturally, but don't stuff. Google penalizes keyword stuffing.

**Structure is the same as iOS** but add keyword variations:
- "stock research" and "stock analysis" and "investing research"
- "analyst ratings" and "analyst upgrades" and "price targets"
- Natural keyword density: 2-3% per target keyword
