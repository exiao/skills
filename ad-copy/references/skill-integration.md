# Skill Integration

- **Headlines skill** (`headlines/SKILL.md`): Use hook formulas for ad headlines, TikTok hooks, email subject lines. The layered hook system applies to landing pages (hero → subhead → body → CTA).
- **Google Ads skill** (`google-ads/SKILL.md`): Use for campaign management, performance queries, and pausing underperformers. This skill writes the copy; that skill deploys and measures it.
- **Meta Ads skill** (`meta-ads/SKILL.md`): Use for creating/managing Meta ad creatives and measuring performance.
