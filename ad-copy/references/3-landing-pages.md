# 3. Landing Pages

A landing page has one job: convert visitors into users. One page, one CTA, one action.

### Structure (top to bottom)

#### Hero Section

```
HEADLINE (8-12 words):
"Research Any Stock in 30 Seconds"

SUBHEADLINE (15-25 words):
"Bloom uses AI to break down analyst ratings, insider trades, and earnings.
52,000 investors already use it."

CTA BUTTON:
"Download Free" (primary)
"See How It Works" (secondary, for non-ready visitors)

VISUAL:

```

**Hero rules:**
- Headline = biggest benefit, not product name
- Subheadline = how it works + social proof
- CTA above the fold. Always.
- Show the product. People want to see what they're getting.

#### Problem Section

```
HEADER: "Researching Stocks Shouldn't Take Hours"

You're juggling Yahoo Finance, SEC filings, Reddit threads, and CNBC alerts.
By the time you piece it all together, the move already happened.

```

Name the specific pain. "Investing is hard" is not a problem statement. "You're checking 6 sources to make one decision" is.

#### Solution Section

```
HEADER: "One Screen. Every Insight."

Bloom reads the filings, tracks the analysts, monitors insider trades, and
summarizes it all in plain English.

FEATURE BLOCKS (3 max, benefit-first):
1. "30-Second Research" — Search any stock, get the full picture instantly
2. "Real-Time Alerts" — Analyst upgrades, insider buys, earnings surprises
3. "AI That Cites Sources" — Not a black box. See exactly where insights come from.
```

**Rules:**
- 3 features max. More than 3 is a feature dump, not a value prop.
- Each feature = benefit headline + one-sentence explanation
- Benefit first, feature second: "Research in 30 seconds" (benefit) using "AI-powered analysis" (feature)

#### Social Proof Section

```
HEADER: "52,000 Investors Already Use Bloom"

★★★★★ "I found a 40% undervalued stock in my first week."
— @InvestorMike, App Store review

★★★★★ "Replaced Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, and 3 other apps."
— @SarahK, App Store review  

★★★★★ "The AI actually explains WHY a stock is moving. Not just that it moved."
— @TraderJohn, App Store review

[App Store badge: 4.8★ from 2,400+ ratings]
[As featured in: TechCrunch, Product Hunt #1]
```

**Rules:**
- Real reviews only. Fake testimonials are illegal and detectable.
- Specific results > general praise. "Found a 40% undervalued stock" > "Great app!"
- Include name/handle for credibility
- Show aggregate rating (4.8★) for quick scanning
- 3 testimonials is the sweet spot. More = diminishing returns.

#### Objection Handling

Address the top 3-5 reasons someone would NOT convert. Put these below social proof.

```
"Is it really free?"
Yes. Download and basic research are completely free. No credit card required.
Premium unlocks unlimited AI conversations and advanced alerts.

"Is the AI actually good?"
Bloom's AI cites its sources. Every insight links back to the filing, transcript,
or data point it came from. No hallucinated financial advice.

"I already use [competitor]."
Bloom isn't a replacement for your brokerage. It's a research layer that makes
every platform better. Use Bloom to research, use your broker to trade.

"Is my data safe?"
Bloom doesn't access your brokerage accounts. Read-only market data. Your 
portfolio data stays on your device.
```

#### CTA Section (Bottom)

```
HEADER: "Research Your First Stock in 60 Seconds"

[CTA Button: "Download Free"]

Free. No credit card. Available on iOS and Android.
```

Repeat the CTA at the bottom. Many people scroll the entire page before deciding. Give them an easy action at every scroll depth.

### Landing Page Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Multiple CTAs competing for attention (pick ONE primary action)
- ❌ Navigation menu with links away from the page (remove nav on landing pages)
- ❌ Stock photos of smiling people pointing at phones
- ❌ Feature lists with no benefits attached
- ❌ "Learn More" as CTA text (learn more about what? be specific)
- ❌ Walls of text with no visual breaks
- ❌ Pop-ups that appear before the visitor has read anything
- ❌ No social proof anywhere on the page
