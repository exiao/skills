# Brand Voice Reference

**Read `~/marketing/WRITING-STYLE.md`** before writing any copy. Bloom's voice is concrete, specific, honest, and irreverent. Even in ads, we sound like a smart friend, not a corporation. "Start investing smarter" is generic. "See exactly why Tesla dropped 12% before your coworker does" is Bloom.

## Voice and Tone Matrix

Before writing, pin the brand on each axis. Bloom's defaults shown — adjust per context (e.g., error states skew more serious; TikTok skews more casual).

| Axis | ← | → | Bloom default |
|------|---|---|---------------|
| Tone | Funny | Serious | 30% funny / 70% serious |
| Register | Casual | Formal | Casual |
| Edge | Irreverent | Respectful | Leans irreverent |
| Energy | Enthusiastic | Matter-of-fact | Matter-of-fact (facts > hype) |

Use this to gut-check drafts: does the copy land where it should on each axis? If a line reads too corporate (formal + respectful + serious), it's off-brand.

## Messaging Hierarchy

Work top-down when building a campaign. Each level feeds the next.

1. **Tagline** — one sentence, timeless, brand-level (e.g., "Invest like you mean it")
2. **Value proposition** — what the product does and for whom, one sentence
3. **Key messages** — 3 proof points that back the value prop
4. **Proof points** — specific data, stories, or stats that make each key message credible

Don't skip to proof points. If the value prop is unclear, the proof points won't land.
