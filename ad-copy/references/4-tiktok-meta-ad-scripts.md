# 4. TikTok / Meta Ad Scripts

Video ads follow a strict rhythm. Every second is earned.

### The Universal Ad Script Structure

```
HOOK (0-3 seconds)     — Stop the scroll. Pattern interrupt.
PROBLEM (3-8 seconds)  — Name their pain. Be specific.
SOLUTION (8-18 seconds)— Show the product solving the problem.
PROOF (18-23 seconds)  — Social proof, results, credibility.
CTA (23-30 seconds)    — Tell them exactly what to do.
```

Total: 25-30 seconds for conversion ads. Shorter is better. If you can do it in 15 seconds, do it in 15 seconds.

### Script Templates

#### Template 1: "I Found the Thing" (Personal Discovery)

```
HOOK (0-2s):
[Text overlay: "The app Wall Street doesn't want you to have"]
[Voice]: "I've been using this one app for all my stock research..."

PROBLEM (2-7s):
"I used to spend HOURS reading analyst reports and SEC filings.
Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, Reddit, earnings transcripts...
by the time I had a thesis, the stock already moved."

SOLUTION (7-17s):
"Then I found Bloom. You search any stock and it gives you
EVERYTHING: analyst ratings, insider trades, earnings breakdowns,
bull case, bear case. In like 30 seconds."
[Show app UI: search stock → AI analysis appearing]

PROOF (17-22s):
"It's got a 4.8 star rating. 52,000 investors use it.
And the AI actually shows you WHERE it got the information."

CTA (22-27s):
"It's free to download. Link is in my bio."
[Text overlay: "Download Bloom — Free"]
```

#### Template 2: "Did You Know?" (Information Gap)

```
HOOK (0-2s):
[Text overlay: "90% of investors miss this"]
[Voice]: "Did you know you can see exactly what company insiders
are buying and selling?"

PROBLEM (2-6s):
"CEOs and board members buy their own stock before it goes up.
It's all public data. But most people don't know where to find it."

SOLUTION (6-16s):
"This app is called Bloom. It tracks every insider trade and
sends you an alert when an executive makes a big buy."
[Show app: insider trading screen with real data]

PROOF (16-20s):
"Last month it flagged three stocks where insiders were loading up.
All three are up double digits."

CTA (20-25s):
"Free download, link in bio."
[Text overlay: "Bloom — Free Stock Research"]
```

#### Template 3: "Hot Take / Contrarian" (Opinion-Led)

```
HOOK (0-2s):
[Text overlay: "Unpopular opinion"]
[Voice]: "If you're still using Yahoo Finance for stock research,
you're doing it wrong."

PROBLEM (2-6s):
"Yahoo gives you a wall of numbers with no context.
You still have to figure out what it all means yourself."

SOLUTION (6-15s):
"There's this AI app that actually EXPLAINS the numbers.
You search Tesla and it tells you: here are the 3 reasons analysts
are bullish, here's the bear case, here's what insiders are doing."
[Show app UI]

PROOF (15-19s):
"4.8 stars. Over 50,000 investors."

CTA (19-23s):
"Download Bloom free. Link in bio."
```

#### Template 4: "Screen Recording" (Product Demo)

```
HOOK (0-2s):
[Screen recording starting mid-action]
[Text overlay: "How I research stocks in 30 seconds"]

DEMO (2-20s):
[Record actual app usage]:
- Open Bloom
- Search "NVDA"  
- Show AI analysis loading
- Scroll through analyst ratings
- Show insider trading data
- Show earnings breakdown

[Voice over the recording]:
"Search any stock. Boom — full AI breakdown. Analyst ratings
right here. Insider trades. Earnings surprises.
This would've taken me an hour on Yahoo Finance."

CTA (20-25s):
"App is called Bloom. Free download."
[Text overlay: "Bloom — Link in Bio"]
```

### Viral Hook Principles (validated: 18M views, zero audience, zero budget)

These four rules override any template when there's a conflict. A solo dev applied them to get 18M YouTube Shorts views in 28 days from scratch.

**1. The hook is about the viewer, not the product.**
Every ad that flops opens with the product's features. Every ad that goes viral opens with something the viewer experiences, fears, wants, or wonders about themselves.
- ❌ "Bloom's AI analyzes every stock for you" (about the product)
- ✅ "I let an AI pick my stocks for 30 days and I wasn't ready for what it found" (about the experience)

**2. Broad angle > niche angle.**
"Investing app" reaches investors. "What if you could see what hedge funds buy before it hits the news" reaches anyone with money. Find the universal human experience (FOMO, insider edge, outsmarting the system, proving someone wrong) that your product connects to.

**3. Build a curiosity gap — tease early, reveal late.**
Introduce a question or result in the first 3 seconds that you don't answer until the final seconds. People don't stay for the product — they stay because they need the answer. The app demo is just something to look at while they wait.
- Bad: Reveal the stock pick in second 5, then explain it for 25 seconds.
- Good: "This AI bought a stock I would never have touched. Here's what happened." → Show the analysis → reveal the result at 25 seconds.

**4. Every line earns the next.**
If a line explains or teaches without escalating tension, cut it. Information is the reward at the end, not the scaffolding. Read the script line by line — each line should make the viewer more curious, not more informed (until the end).

### TikTok-Specific Rules

1. **Vertical video only** (9:16). No letterboxing.
2. **Text on screen from frame 1.** Audio might be off.
3. **No logos in the first 3 seconds.** It signals "ad" and gets skipped.
4. **Native feel > polished.** Film on phone, not studio. Talk to camera, not at camera.
5. **The hook IS the ad.** If the first 2 seconds don't land, nothing else matters.
6. **Music/trending sound under the voiceover.** Boosts distribution.
7. **CTA = "Link in bio"** (TikTok doesn't support clickable links in organic, only Spark Ads or paid).

### Meta (Facebook/Instagram) Specific Rules

1. **Square (1:1) or vertical (4:5) for feed.** 9:16 for Stories/Reels.
2. **Design for sound-off.** Captions/text overlays on all dialogue.
3. **First 3 seconds must work as a static image** (feed autoplay is often paused).
4. **CTA button text matters.** "Download" converts better than "Learn More" for apps.
5. **Carousel ads**: Each card = one benefit. Card 1 = hook. Last card = CTA.

#### Template 5: "Emotional Arc" (5-Beat Progression)

Longer-form video (30-35s) with deliberate energy shifts that mirror how real people talk about discoveries. Each beat has a distinct emotional tone.

```
BEAT 1: CURIOSITY (0-5s) — Moderate energy, conversational
"okay so I need to tell you about something I just found"
[Lean forward slightly. Interest, not hype. Approachable.]

BEAT 2: FRUSTRATION (5-12s) — Energy dips, relatable pain
"because honestly I was spending hours reading analyst reports
and by the time I had a thesis, the stock already moved"
[Slight head shake. Slower pace. Authentic disappointment.]

BEAT 3: DISCOVERY (12-20s) — Energy builds, genuine excitement
"then I found this app and literally within the first search
I got a full AI breakdown: bull case, bear case, insider trades"
[Show app UI. Brightening expression. Faster pace.]

BEAT 4: VALIDATION (20-28s) — Peak energy, confidence
"like it's showing me what company CEOs are buying before
the stock moves, and it cites every source so I can verify"
[Animated hand gestures. Direct eye contact. This is the proof.]

BEAT 5: RECOMMENDATION (28-35s) — Warm, direct, slightly lower
"if you do any kind of stock research, just try it.
it's called Bloom. free download. you can thank me later"
[Friendly but confident. Natural conclusion, not a hard sell.]
```

**Why the arc matters:** Flat energy = fake. Real testimonials have emotional dynamics. The dip at beat 2 makes the excitement at beats 3-4 feel earned. The slight cooldown at beat 5 signals authenticity (hard sells stay at peak energy, which viewers have learned to distrust).

**Adaptation for shorter formats (15-20s):** Collapse beats 1+2 into a single "problem hook" (0-5s) and beats 4+5 into "proof + CTA" (15-20s). Keep beat 3 (discovery) as the core.

### Video Ad Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Starting with your logo or brand name (instant skip)
- ❌ "Hey guys, so today I want to talk about..." (zero hook)
- ❌ Background music louder than voice
- ❌ Cramming 10 features into 30 seconds (pick 2-3)
- ❌ Professional studio lighting for organic-style content (feels like an ad)
- ❌ Showing the app for more than 15 seconds without voiceover context
- ❌ Ending without a CTA
- ❌ "Check it out" as a CTA (check WHAT out WHERE?)
