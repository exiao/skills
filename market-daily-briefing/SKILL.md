# Market Daily Briefing

Delivers a concise, narrative market briefing covering earnings results, economic data, and notable stock moves. Prioritizes stories that matter to Bloom users.

---

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Serper** (`web-search` skill, `SERPER_API_KEY`) | Search for earnings results, analyst reactions, market news |
| **Firecrawl** (`FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`) | Scrape full articles when Serper snippets cut off before the numbers |
| **Bloom MCP** (`https://api.getbloom.app/mcp/`, Bearer: `test-api-key`) | Check what stocks Bloom users are watching — front-load coverage of these |

---

## What to Cover

### 1. Earnings Results (Today + Last Night)
For each notable company that reported:
- Beat or miss (EPS and revenue vs. consensus)
- How the stock reacted (after-hours move or today's open)
- 2-3 interesting takeaways: guidance changes, margin shifts, subscriber growth, segment commentary

Prioritize: mega-caps, widely-held names, dramatic movers (>5%), anything popular on Bloom.

### 2. Market-Moving News
- Fed comments or policy signals
- Economic data releases (CPI, jobs, GDP, PMI)
- Major sector rotations
- Single-stock moves >5% not covered above
- M&A announcements
- Regulatory news

---

## Output Format

- Title: `📊 Morning Market Briefing — [date]`
- Conversational narrative — no tables, no bullet dumps
- Lead with the most important story
- On quiet days: 2-3 sentences is fine
- **Max 2000 characters** (Signal limit)

---

## Delivery

### Signal (primary)
Send to: `signal group:5TgLlI8NfnETVAzVvUi0rJ0WKz2Pz2Flj5i2/VAcFSY=`

```python
# Use message tool
channel = "signal"
target = "group:5TgLlI8NfnETVAzVvUi0rJ0WKz2Pz2Flj5i2/VAcFSY="
```

### Typefully (secondary — @investwithbloom)
After Signal, create a public-facing tweet of the sharpest single data point:

```bash
cd /Users/testuser/clawd/skills/typefully
node scripts/typefully.js drafts:create 286685 \
  --platform x \
  --text "<post text>" \
  --schedule next-free-slot
```

Tweet guidelines:
- Max 280 characters
- Lead with the most striking number or fact
- Conversational, not robotic. No hashtags unless they add value.
- Frame as market intelligence, not a recap
- Don't copy the Signal briefing verbatim — distill to one sharp point

## Common Mistakes

1. **Missing Bloom MCP check** — Always check what stocks Bloom users are watching. User-held stocks belong front and center.
2. **Truncated earnings numbers** — Serper snippets often cut off before EPS/revenue figures. Use Firecrawl on the earnings press release when numbers are missing.
3. **Skipping stock reaction** — A beat/miss means nothing without the stock's actual % move. Always include both.
4. **Too long** — Under 2000 characters. If it's longer, cut. Quiet days = 2-3 sentences.
5. **Copying Signal verbatim to Typefully** — Public post needs to be distilled to one sharp point, not a copy-paste.
