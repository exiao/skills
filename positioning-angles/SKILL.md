# Positioning Angles Engine

Find the angle that makes people say "oh, I need that." Not the words — the *frame*. Positioning is the strategic decision that happens before you write a single headline.

**Headlines = what you say. Positioning = what you *mean*.**

Same product, different positioning:
- "Free stock trading" (Robinhood) → cost-conscious beginners
- "Invest spare change" (Acorns) → people scared of investing
- "AI-powered investing research" (Bloom) → active traders who want an edge

Three apps. Same category. Completely different angles. The angle determines everything downstream: the headlines, the landing page, the App Store screenshots, the TikTok hooks, the investor pitch.
