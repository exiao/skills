# Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

### 1. Vague Positioning
- ❌ "The best investing app"
- ❌ "A better way to invest"  
- ❌ "Invest with confidence"
- ❌ "The future of investing"
- ❌ "Smart investing made simple"

These could describe literally any app. They communicate nothing. They're the equivalent of "we exist." Delete them.

**Fix:** Replace with a specific claim. "Research any stock in 30 seconds" is a *claim*. "Smart investing" is air.

### 2. Feature-Listing Instead of Benefit-Framing
- ❌ "AI-powered analysis, real-time data, portfolio tracking, and news aggregation"
- ✅ "Ask any question about your stocks and get a cited answer in 30 seconds"

Features are ingredients. Benefits are the meal. Nobody orders "flour, eggs, sugar, butter." They order cake.

**The test:** After every feature, ask "so what?" until you hit an emotion or outcome.
- "We use AI" → so what? → "It analyzes stocks" → so what? → "You get research in 30 seconds instead of 2 hours" → so what? → "You stop second-guessing every trade" → THAT's the benefit.

### 3. Trying to Be Everything to Everyone
- ❌ "For beginners AND experts, traders AND long-term investors, crypto AND stocks"
- ✅ Pick one. Own it. Expand later.

Robinhood started with "free stock trading for beginners." Not "a comprehensive investing platform for all experience levels." They could have said the latter — it was true. But it would have meant nothing.

**The rule:** If you're for everyone, you're for no one. The narrower your positioning, the sharper the resonance. You can always broaden later.

### 4. Positioning By Features You Don't Own
- ❌ "Fast" (anyone can say this)
- ❌ "Easy to use" (everyone claims this)
- ❌ "Secure" (table stakes, not positioning)
- ❌ "Reliable" (this is a minimum expectation)

**The test:** Can a competitor truthfully say the same thing? Then it's not positioning. It's a feature claim. Positioning must be *yours*.

### 5. Changing Positioning Weekly
Positioning is a strategic decision, not a copy test. You test *angles* to find the winner, then you *commit*. Changing your positioning every time a headline underperforms means you never build recognition.

**The rule:** Test for 2-4 weeks. Pick the winner. Commit for at least 3-6 months. Only revisit if the market fundamentally changes (new competitor, product pivot, audience shift).

### 6. Positioning That Requires Your Product to Explain
If someone reads your positioning and still doesn't understand what you do until they use the product, you've failed. Positioning must work *before* the experience.

- ❌ "Think different" → only worked after Apple was already iconic. You can't do this at zero brand recognition.
- ✅ "ChatGPT for your portfolio" → immediately understood by anyone, at any awareness level.

### 7. Corporate Jargon Positioning
- ❌ "Empowering investors with cutting-edge AI-driven insights for optimal portfolio performance"
- ✅ "Ask your stocks anything. Get real answers."

If you wouldn't say it to a friend at a bar, it's not positioning. It's a press release.
