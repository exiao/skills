# Usage

When asked to develop positioning:

1. **Ask for the product dump** (Step 1 questions) if not provided
2. **Extract primitives** (audiences, pains, outcomes, differentiators, analogies, enemies)
3. **Generate 15-20 angles** across all 7 frameworks
4. **Kill the weak** using the filter criteria
5. **Build the audience-channel matrix** for surviving angles
6. **Build the positioning stack** for the top 3 angles
7. **Produce the positioning brief** in the output format above
8. **Recommend a testing plan** with specific test setups for their budget/channels
9. **Connect to downstream skills**: suggest headlines (→ `headlines` skill), ad copy, content hooks

Always be opinionated. Don't present 15 angles and say "pick one." Recommend the top 3 with clear reasoning. Say which one you'd bet on and why.

When generating positioning for Bloom specifically, reference the competitive landscape (Robinhood, Webull, Fidelity, Yahoo Finance, generic AI wrappers) and position against the category's weaknesses, not specific competitors.
