# The Positioning Stack

Every product needs these 5 layers. They're not interchangeable — each serves a different context.

### 1. One-Liner (7 words or fewer)
The thing you say at a party when someone asks "what do you do?"

- **Robinhood:** "Free stock trading"
- **Calm:** "Sleep stories"
- **Duolingo:** "Free language learning"
- **Notion:** "All-in-one workspace"
- **Bloom:** "AI-powered investing research" / "ChatGPT for your portfolio" / "Your AI stock analyst"

**Where it lives:** App Store subtitle, social media bio, Google Ads headline, the first thing on your landing page.

**Test:** Say it to your mom. If she understands what you do, it works. If she says "what does that mean?", rewrite.

### 2. Elevator Pitch (2-3 sentences)
The 30-second version. Problem → solution → why you.

**Template:**
"[Target audience] [has this problem]. [Product] [does this thing] so they can [achieve this outcome]. Unlike [alternatives], we [key differentiator]."

**Bloom example:**
"Investors waste hours researching stocks across scattered tools. Bloom is an AI analyst that knows your portfolio and gives you actionable insights through conversation. Unlike generic AI tools, Bloom is built specifically for investing and cites real financial data."

**Where it lives:** App Store description (first paragraph), about page, investor pitch deck (slide 2), cold emails.

### 3. Value Proposition (Benefit-first, feature-supported)
The promise you make, backed by how you deliver.

**Template:**
"[Primary benefit] through [mechanism]. [Proof point]."

**Bloom example:**
"Get institutional-quality research for any stock in 30 seconds through AI-powered analysis of earnings, financials, and market data. Used by 10K+ investors daily."

**Where it lives:** Landing page hero section, App Store first screenshot caption, ad copy body.

### 4. Tagline (Memorable, repeatable)
The thing people remember and repeat. Not a description — a feeling.

**Rules:**
- Under 6 words
- Must sound good spoken aloud
- Should work without context (on a t-shirt, as a bumper sticker)
- NOT a description of the product

**Bloom tagline options:**
- "Research, not guesswork."
- "Your portfolio. Explained."
- "Invest smarter, not harder." (cliché, but clear)
- "The analyst in your pocket."
- "Ask your stocks anything."

**Where it lives:** Logo lockup, merch, app icon tagline, video outros.

### 5. Category Claim (What are you?)
The sentence that tells the market what box to put you in.

**Template:** "[Product] is a [category] that [key differentiator]."

**Bloom example:**
"Bloom is an AI investing research app that gives you personalized, source-cited analysis of any stock through natural conversation."

**Where it lives:** Press releases, App Store primary category selection, G2/Product Hunt listing, Wikipedia-style descriptions.
