# The Positioning Brief (Output Format)

After running this process, produce this document. It feeds directly into `headlines`, `direct-response-copy`, `content-atomizer`, and any other downstream skill.

## Messaging Hierarchy

Before writing the brief, establish the messaging stack top-down. Each level feeds the next. Don't skip levels.

1. **Tagline** — one sentence, timeless, brand-level (e.g., "Invest like you mean it")
2. **Value proposition** — what the product does and for whom, in one sentence
3. **Key messages** — 3 proof points that back the value prop
4. **Proof points** — specific data, stories, or stats that make each key message credible

If the value prop is fuzzy, the angles below it won't hold.
