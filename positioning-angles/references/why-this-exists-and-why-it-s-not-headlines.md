# Why This Exists (And Why It's Not Headlines)

The `headlines` skill helps you write scroll-stopping titles. This skill helps you figure out **what to say** before you write anything. 

Most products fail at positioning, not copywriting. You can write the best headline in the world for the wrong angle and get zero conversions. A mediocre headline on the right angle will crush it.

**Signs you have a positioning problem:**
- Your landing page "sounds good" but doesn't convert
- You keep rewriting copy and nothing works
- People say "cool" but don't sign up
- You can't explain what you do in one sentence without listing features
- Different team members describe the product differently
- Your ads get clicks but not downloads/signups
