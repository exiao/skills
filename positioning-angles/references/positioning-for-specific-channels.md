# Positioning for Specific Channels

### App Store Description
- **Subtitle (30 chars):** Your one-liner. This is the most important positioning real estate you have.
- **First sentence:** Restate the positioning angle in benefit language. Not features.
- **Screenshots:** Each screenshot should reinforce the positioning. If your angle is "ChatGPT for your portfolio," every screenshot should show the conversational interface with real stock data.
- **Keywords:** Your positioning angle should match high-volume keywords. If nobody searches for your made-up category, category creation will hurt you here.

### Google Ads
- **Headline 1:** Primary positioning angle (30 chars)
- **Headline 2:** Outcome or proof point (30 chars)
- **Headline 3:** Social proof or CTA (30 chars)
- **Description:** Elevator pitch condensed to 90 chars

Google Ads is the fastest positioning test because you get CTR data within 48 hours. Run every positioning angle as a headline variant.

### Landing Page
- **Hero headline:** Primary positioning angle
- **Hero subheadline:** The "why" behind the positioning (proof, mechanism, or outcome)
- **CTA button:** Should echo the positioning. If you're "ChatGPT for investing," the CTA could be "Ask your first question" not "Sign up free."
- **Below the fold:** Address secondary audiences with their specific angles

### TikTok / Short-Form Video
- **First 2 seconds = the positioning angle as a hook**
- Use `headlines` skill TikTok section for hook writing after positioning is decided
- The positioning determines the *concept* of the video. The hook determines the *execution*.
- Example: Positioning = "replaces 2 hours of research." Video concept = showing the 2-hour process compressed into 30 seconds with AI.

### Investor Pitch
- **Slide 1:** One-liner + category claim
- **Slide 2:** The problem (current positioning of incumbents + why it's broken)
- **Slide 3:** Your positioning (how you're different, framed as market opportunity)
- Use "X for Y" aggressively in investor contexts. VCs love pattern-matching.
- Add market size to every positioning statement: "AI-powered investing research in a $3T retail investing market"

### Social Media Bio
- Your bio IS your positioning. One line, no waste.
- **Twitter/X:** "[One-liner] | [proof point or tagline]" → "AI investing research | 10K+ investors"
- **TikTok:** "[Outcome]. [CTA]." → "Research any stock with AI. Link in bio."
- **Instagram:** "[Tagline] ⬇️ [CTA]" → "Your AI stock analyst ⬇️ Download free"
