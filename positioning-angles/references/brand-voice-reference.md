# Brand Voice Reference

**Read `~/marketing/WRITING-STYLE.md`** before generating positioning for Eric/Bloom. Positioning language should match: concrete, no corporate fluff, build-in-public energy, specific over vague.

## Voice and Tone Matrix

Positioning language should stay consistent with the brand voice. Pin Bloom on each axis before writing angles:

| Axis | ← | → | Bloom default |
|------|---|---|---------------|
| Tone | Funny | Serious | 30% funny / 70% serious |
| Register | Casual | Formal | Casual |
| Edge | Irreverent | Respectful | Leans irreverent |
| Energy | Enthusiastic | Matter-of-fact | Matter-of-fact (facts > hype) |

Positioning angles that skew too formal or too hype-y will misfire downstream — the copy won't match the frame.
