# The Positioning Generation Process

Here's how to go from "I don't know how to describe my product" to "I have 3 winning angles I'm confident in." This is the systematic process — follow it step by step.

### Step 1: Dump Everything (15 minutes)

Answer these questions in raw, unedited writing. Don't polish. Don't think about marketing. Just answer honestly.

1. **What does your product actually do?** (The literal mechanical description)
2. **What were you frustrated by that made you build it?** (Your origin anger)
3. **What do users say when they describe it to friends?** (Their words, not yours)
4. **What's the first thing that surprised a new user?** (The "oh shit" moment)
5. **What's the closest existing product, and how are you different?** (Honest answer)
6. **Who LOVES your product the most?** (Specific person, not a demographic)
7. **Who tried it and churned? Why?** (The people it's NOT for)
8. **What do you do that nobody else does?** (One thing, not a list)
9. **What would users go back to if your product disappeared?** (Your real competition)
10. **What's the outcome your best user gets?** (Not the feature, the life change)

### Step 2: Extract Positioning Primitives (10 minutes)

From your dump, extract these building blocks:

- **3 audiences** (specific people, not demographics)
- **3 pains** (things that piss them off about the current way)
- **3 outcomes** (what life looks like after using your product)
- **3 differentiators** (things ONLY you do)
- **3 analogies** (products/concepts people already know that you're similar to)
- **3 enemies** (the status quo you're fighting against — not competitors, concepts)

### Step 3: Generate 15-20 Positioning Angles (30 minutes)

Using the 7 frameworks above, generate angles mechanically. You're not looking for "the one" yet — you're creating optionality.

**Run through each framework with your primitives:**

| Framework | Template | Generate |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| X for Y | "[Analogy] for [audience]" | 3 angles |
| Category Creation | "[New category name] for [audience]" | 2 angles |
| Competitive Repositioning | "[Status quo] is broken because [flaw]. We [fix]." | 3 angles |
| Replaces X | "Replaces [thing they currently use/do]" | 2 angles |
| Anti-X | "We're the [opposite of flaw]" | 2 angles |
| Identity | "For [type of person] who [value/behavior]" | 2 angles |
| Outcome | "[Result achieved]" | 3 angles |

That gives you 17 angles minimum. Some will be garbage. That's the point — you need volume to find signal.

### Step 4: Kill the Weak (10 minutes)

Apply these filters to eliminate bad angles:

**Instant kill:**
- ❌ Could describe 10 other products (too generic)
- ❌ Requires explanation ("what do you mean by that?")
- ❌ Lists features instead of framing a benefit
- ❌ Uses words like "empower," "leverage," "unlock," "revolutionize," "seamless"
- ❌ Tries to be for everyone ("the best [X] app")
- ❌ Can't be said in conversation without sounding like a robot

**Weak signals (consider killing):**
- ⚠️ Sounds impressive but doesn't create urgency
- ⚠️ True but not compelling (so what?)
- ⚠️ Clever wordplay that doesn't land at a bar
- ⚠️ Requires knowledge of your product to understand

You should be left with 6-10 surviving angles.

### Step 5: Audience-Channel Matrix (20 minutes)

Your surviving angles don't all work for every audience or every channel. Map them.

**Create this matrix:**

| Angle | Gen Z | Millennials | Boomers | App Store | Google Ads | TikTok | Landing Page | Investor Pitch |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|-----------|------------|--------|--------------|----------------|
| "ChatGPT for your portfolio" | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ |
| "Stop googling stock advice" | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| "The anti-Robinhood" | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ |

**Audience-specific positioning examples for an investing app:**

**Gen Z (18-25):**
- Lead with: accessibility, free, AI-native, anti-establishment
- "Your AI investing bestie" / "Stop losing money on Reddit picks"
- Channels: TikTok, Instagram Reels
- Tone: casual, meme-aware, slightly irreverent

**Millennials (26-40):**
- Lead with: intelligence, efficiency, replaces-manual-work
- "ChatGPT for your portfolio" / "Research any stock in 30 seconds"
- Channels: Google Ads, landing pages, Twitter/X
- Tone: competent, no-bullshit, tool-focused

**Gen X / Boomers (40+):**
- Lead with: trust, clarity, "finally makes sense"
- "Your portfolio, explained in plain English" / "The analyst that never sleeps"
- Channels: Google Ads, Facebook, App Store search
- Tone: reassuring, professional, no jargon

### Step 6: Test With Real Spend (1-2 weeks)

You cannot test positioning by asking friends. Friends lie. You test with real humans spending real attention.

#### Test 1: Google Ads Headline Test (Fastest signal, $50-200)

**Setup:**
1. Create a Google Ads campaign for your product's keywords
2. Write 3-5 different ad headlines, each using a different positioning angle
3. Same description, same landing page, same keywords — only the headline changes
4. Run for 3-5 days or until each variant has 200+ impressions

**What to measure:**
- **CTR (click-through rate)** → which angle makes people click?
- **CPC (cost per click)** → lower CPC usually means higher relevance
- NOT conversion rate (the landing page is the same, so conversion tests the page, not the angle)

**Example test for Bloom:**
- Headline A: "AI Stock Research App" (category)
- Headline B: "ChatGPT for Your Portfolio" (X for Y)
- Headline C: "Stop Googling Stock Advice" (anti-X/pain)
- Headline D: "Research Any Stock in 30 Seconds" (outcome)
- Headline E: "Your AI Investing Analyst" (identity)

#### Test 2: App Store Listing A/B Test (Highest signal, $0)

**Setup (Apple):**
1. Use App Store Connect's Product Page Optimization (PPO)
2. Create 3 treatment pages with different subtitle + first screenshot
3. Each treatment uses a different positioning angle
4. Apple auto-splits traffic and shows statistical significance

**Setup (Google Play):**
1. Use Google Play Console's Store Listing Experiments
2. Test short description + feature graphic variations
3. Measure install rate per variant

**What to measure:**
- **Install rate** (impressions → installs) — the only metric that matters

**Example test for Bloom:**
- Treatment A subtitle: "AI-Powered Stock Research" + screenshot showing chat interface
- Treatment B subtitle: "Your Portfolio, Explained" + screenshot showing portfolio insights
- Treatment C subtitle: "ChatGPT for Investing" + screenshot showing AI analysis

#### Test 3: TikTok Hook Test (Widest reach, $0-100)

**Setup:**
1. Create 3-5 near-identical videos (same content, different first 3 seconds)
2. Each video opens with a different positioning angle as the hook
3. Post organically or run as Spark Ads with $20-50 each

**What to measure:**
- **3-second retention rate** → which angle stops the scroll?
- **Watch-through rate** → which angle's promise is compelling enough to stay?
- **Comments** → what are people saying? Do they understand the positioning?

**Example hooks for Bloom:**
- Hook A: "I replaced my entire stock research workflow with one app" (replaces X)
- Hook B: "This is literally ChatGPT for your portfolio" (X for Y)
- Hook C: "Stop googling 'should I buy [stock]'" (pain/anti-X)

#### Test 4: Landing Page Hero Test (Deepest signal, $100-500)

**Setup:**
1. Create 2-3 landing page variants (use Framer, Webflow, or simple HTML)
2. Each variant has a different hero headline + subheadline using a different angle
3. Drive identical traffic to each (Google Ads, social, etc.)
4. Run for 1-2 weeks or until each has 500+ visitors

**What to measure:**
- **Signup/download conversion rate** — the ultimate test
- **Scroll depth** — are people reading past the hero?
- **Time on page** — are they engaged?

### Step 7: Converge on Winners (After testing)

After running tests, you'll have signal. Now converge:

1. **Rank your angles by performance** across all tests
2. **Look for consistency** — an angle that wins in Google Ads AND TikTok is stronger than one that wins in only one channel
3. **Pick 1 primary angle** for your brand positioning (this goes everywhere — App Store, landing page, pitch deck)
4. **Pick 1-2 secondary angles** for specific audiences or channels (e.g., Gen Z TikTok angle vs. Google Ads angle)
5. **Build your positioning stack** (one-liner, elevator pitch, value prop, tagline, category claim) around the primary angle
6. **Feed the winners into other skills**: headlines, direct-response-copy, content-atomizer
