# The 7 Positioning Frameworks

Every great product position fits into one (sometimes two) of these frameworks. Know all of them, then pick the one that creates the most tension with the status quo.

### 1. "X for Y" (Analogy Positioning)

Borrow credibility from something everyone knows.

**Formula:** "[Known thing] for [your audience/niche]"

**Examples:**
- Slack = "Email killer for teams"
- Figma = "Google Docs for design"
- Notion = "Lego blocks for work tools"
- Robinhood = "Free stock trading for everyone"
- Bloom = "ChatGPT for stock research" / "Perplexity for investing"

**When to use:** When your product does something familiar but for a new audience or in a new way. Works exceptionally well for App Store descriptions, investor pitches, and TikTok hooks.

**Rules:**
- The X must be universally known. "Figma for X" works because everyone in tech knows Figma. "Basecamp for X" is weaker — less universal.
- The Y must be a real, identifiable group, not a vague market. "for Gen Z investors" > "for young people."
- The analogy must be *instantly* clear. If you need to explain why you're like X, the analogy failed.
- **Test it**: Say it to a stranger. If they immediately understand what you do, it works. If they ask follow-up questions about the analogy itself, it's broken.

**Bloom examples:**
- "ChatGPT for your portfolio" → implies conversational, AI-powered, knows your holdings
- "A Bloomberg terminal in your pocket" → implies power user tools, mobile-first
- "Perplexity for stocks" → implies research-grade, source-cited, not hallucinating
- "Your AI analyst" → implies it does the work you'd hire an analyst to do

### 2. Category Creation

Don't compete in an existing category. Create your own and be the default.

**Formula:** Define a new category name and own it.

**Examples:**
- Drift didn't say "live chat." They created "conversational marketing."
- HubSpot created "inbound marketing."
- Calm didn't say "meditation app." They pivoted to "sleep stories." New category. Owned it.
- Superhuman created "the fastest email experience" — speed as a category.

**When to use:** When existing categories are crowded and your product's real value doesn't fit neatly into any of them. Also when you're truly doing something nobody else does.

**How to create a category:**
1. Name the thing you do that nobody else does. Not a feature — a *behavior*.
2. The name must be self-explanatory. "Conversational marketing" = marketing through conversations. Clear.
3. Attach a manifesto. Category creation requires evangelism. You need a "why this category exists" narrative.
4. Be willing to educate. Category creation is slower than category entry. But the upside is owning the entire space.

**Bloom category creation options:**
- "AI investing research" → you're not a trading app, not a robo-advisor, not a news feed. You're a new thing.
- "Portfolio intelligence" → your AI knows your holdings and gives personalized insights
- "Conversational investing" → investing through chat, not through screens of numbers
- "AI-native investing" → implies everything else is AI-bolted-on

**Warning:** Category creation only works if the category is *real*. If you're just renaming what everyone else does, people see through it instantly. The category must describe a genuinely different experience.

### 3. Competitive Repositioning

Change how people see the incumbent to make your product the obvious choice.

**Formula:** Reframe the existing solution as outdated/broken/wrong, then present yours as the natural evolution.

**Examples:**
- Basecamp: "Project management tools are too complex. We're the simple alternative." (Repositions Jira/Asana as bloated.)
- Apple: "1,000 songs in your pocket." (Repositions portable CD players as bulky and limited.)
- Tesla: Didn't say "electric car." Said "the fastest production car ever made." (Repositions gas cars as slow.)

**Rules for competitive repositioning:**
- **Never name the competitor directly.** Say "traditional X" or "most X tools" or "the old way." Naming them gives them attention and makes you look small.
- **Attack the category, not the company.** "Most investing apps just show you the same data Yahoo Finance has for free" → attacks every competitor without naming any.
- **Use a proxy comparison.** Compare to the *experience* of using them, not the product itself. "Refreshing your portfolio 47 times a day" (attacks the anxiety of Robinhood-style apps without naming Robinhood).

**Bloom competitive repositioning:**
- "Most investing apps show you numbers. They don't tell you what they mean." → repositions every data-dump app
- "You don't need another stock screener. You need an analyst who knows your portfolio." → repositions traditional tools
- "AI investing tools that just Google things for you aren't investing tools." → repositions wrapper apps
- "Checking your portfolio shouldn't give you anxiety." → repositions gamified trading apps

### 4. "Replaces X" Framing

Position your product as the thing that eliminates something people already pay for (in money, time, or pain).

**Formula:** "[Product] replaces [thing they currently use/do]"

**Examples:**
- Superhuman: "Replaces 3 hours of email with 30 minutes"
- Notion: "Replaces your wiki, project tracker, and docs"
- Calendly: "Replaces the 8-email scheduling dance"
- Linear: "Replaces Jira" (they literally said it)

**When to use:** When your audience is currently using something they hate, paying for something they resent, or doing something manually that your product automates. The stronger their pain with the current solution, the better this works.

**Bloom "replaces" angles:**
- "Replaces the 2 hours of research you do before every trade"
- "Replaces your morning routine of checking 6 different finance sites"
- "Replaces the $200/month Bloomberg terminal"
- "Replaces Reddit DD threads" → risky but memorable
- "Replaces googling 'is [stock] a good buy'"

### 5. "Anti-X" Positioning

Define yourself by what you're NOT.

**Formula:** "We're the [opposite of what's broken about the status quo]"

**Examples:**
- Basecamp: "We're not Jira" (the anti-complexity position)
- Hey.com: "Email that doesn't spy on you" (anti-surveillance)
- DuckDuckGo: "The search engine that doesn't track you" (anti-Google)
- Signal: "No ads. No trackers. No kidding." (anti-WhatsApp/Meta)

**When to use:** When the incumbent has a glaring flaw that pisses people off, and your product fixes it. Works best when the incumbent's flaw is *structural* — they can't fix it without changing their business model.

**Rules:**
- You must actually BE the anti. If you say "we don't spy on you" but you sell data, this blows up catastrophically.
- The thing you're anti must be something people *actually care about*. "Anti-blue-interface" means nothing.
- This positioning attracts passionate users but limits your market. DuckDuckGo will never be bigger than Google. That's the tradeoff.

**Bloom "anti" angles:**
- "The investing app that doesn't gamify your money" (anti-Robinhood confetti/dopamine)
- "AI that shows its sources, not just its opinions" (anti-hallucination, anti-black-box)
- "No payment for order flow. No gamification. No bullshit." (anti-everything-wrong-with-fintech)
- "Investing without the anxiety" (anti-red/green portfolio dopamine)
- "The app that tells you NOT to trade" (anti-churn, anti-overtrading)

### 6. Identity Positioning

Position around WHO the user becomes, not WHAT the product does.

**Formula:** "[Product] is for [identity] who [behavior/value]"

**Examples:**
- Patagonia: You're not buying a jacket. You're an environmentalist.
- Apple: "Think Different" — you're a creative rebel, not a PC drone.
- CrossFit: You're not doing a workout. You're part of a tribe.
- Robinhood: You're not trading stocks. You're democratizing finance.

**When to use:** When your product has strong cultural or tribal associations. When the *type of person* who uses it matters as much as what it does.

**Bloom identity angles:**
- "For investors who do their homework" → identity = the serious, research-driven investor
- "For the investor who reads 10-Ks, not Reddit" → identity = sophisticated, self-directed
- "For people who think about money differently" → identity = contrarian, independent thinker
- "Built for the investor you're becoming" → identity = aspirational, growth-oriented

### 7. Outcome Positioning

Skip what the product is entirely. Lead with the result.

**Formula:** "[Outcome achieved] + [implicit product]"

**Examples:**
- Duolingo: "Learn a language for free" → the outcome IS the product
- Calm: "Sleep more. Stress less." → nobody cares it's a meditation app
- Headspace: "Be kind to your mind" → outcome-first
- Wealthfront: "Grow your savings on autopilot" → result, not mechanism

**When to use:** When the outcome is more compelling than the mechanism. When people don't care about the "how," only the "what happens."

**Bloom outcome angles:**
- "Make smarter trades" → simple, direct outcome
- "Know what's really happening with your stocks" → outcome = understanding
- "Stop wondering if you should sell" → outcome = confidence, decisiveness
- "Beat the guesswork" → outcome = informed decisions over hunches
- "Your portfolio, explained" → outcome = clarity
