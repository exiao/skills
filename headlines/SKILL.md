# Headlines & Hooks Engine

Generate scroll-stopping titles, subtitles, and opening hooks for articles, posts, and videos.

## LinkedIn Hook Formula

LinkedIn shows exactly 2 lines before the "…more" button. That cutoff is the only conversion that matters. If readers don't click "…more", nothing else counts.

**Constraints:**
- 2 lines max, each ≤55 characters
- Never about the author — always about the reader or a universal tension
- Creates an open loop: unanswered question, contradiction, or bold claim
- No emoji openers, no hashtags, no personal achievements

**5 pattern-interrupt techniques:**

| Technique | Formula | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Contradiction | Say something that sounds wrong | "The worst posts get the most followers." |
| Specific number + twist | Number + unexpected result | "I deleted 500 connections. Reach went up 40%." |
| Direct accusation | Call the reader out | "You're writing for your mom, not your market." |
| Stolen thought | Say what they secretly think | "You already know your posts are boring." |
| Absurd reframe | Make the mundane dramatic | "Your hook has 1.2 seconds. Most waste all of them." |

**Process:** Generate 10 variants (2 per technique). Don't pick the "safest" one — pick the one that made you wince slightly.
