# Layered Hooks

Every piece of content needs multiple hook layers:

**Layer 1 — Title:** Grabs them in the feed. One sentence. Power words first.
**Layer 2 — Subtitle:** Keeps them clicking through. Foreshadows the payoff.
**Layer 3 — First sentence:** Creates an open loop. Delays the payoff.
**Layer 4+ — Mini hooks in body:** "But here's where it gets crazy…", "Wait until you see this part…", "This last one is the most important."

Create open loops and delay the payoff at every layer.
