# Better Openers (Post-Draft)

Inspired by Sudowrite's Better Openers plugin (7.1k users). After the article is drafted, revisit the opening line/paragraph using the full context of the piece.

**The problem:** Most first drafts open with throat-clearing because the writer is warming up. The real opener is usually buried 2-3 paragraphs in.

**The fix:** Read the finished draft, then rewrite the opening to:
1. Immediately establish the emotional tone of the piece
2. Contain at least 2 hook types from the list above
3. Introduce an element of tension, consequence, or surprise
4. Generate 3 alternative openers and pick the strongest

**Test:** Read your opener, then read your second paragraph. If the piece reads better starting at paragraph 2, your opener is throat-clearing. Cut it or replace it.
