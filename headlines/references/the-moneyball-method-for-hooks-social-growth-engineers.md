# The Moneyball Method for Hooks (Social Growth Engineers)

Don't start from scratch. Source hooks scientifically, like Billy Beane sourced undervalued players.

### The Process
1. **Source content from competitors** — pull hooks from similar apps/accounts in your vertical
2. **Source UGC/creator hooks** — find what creators are saying about competitor products
3. **Build a hook library** from all vertical data — hundreds of hooks, organized by performance
4. **Test hooks systematically** — write a series, post across accounts, iterate on what performs
5. **Double down on outliers** — when a hook hits 4x+ median, use it word-for-word repeatedly

**Key insight:** SGE found that the same text hook, used word-for-word across different accounts, consistently outperformed median by 4x-20x. When you find a winning hook, don't change it — replicate it everywhere.

### Trend Hooks (Free Viral Hooks)
At least **one of your weekly hooks should be a current trend**. Why:
- ~50-100% increase in views when using trending sounds
- 61% of TikTok users prefer brands that surf trends
- Maximized watch time because viewers recognize the familiar pattern
- Trends become trends *because* of high engagement potential — you're hacking into built-in comment triggers
- All you need: replicate an existing format and hook

**Examples of trend hooks that drove millions:**
- "I could kiss the girl on the lips who…" + someone who showed you something life-changing → 9M views
- "I'm gonna hold your hand when I say this but…" → 5M+ views
- These are plug-and-play: take the trending template, insert your product angle
