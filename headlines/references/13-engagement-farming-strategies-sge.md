# 13 Engagement Farming Strategies (SGE)

Shares are the #1 algorithmic factor for virality, engagement is #2. Bake engagement hooks into every video to kickstart comments.

### 1. Don't Mention the App Name
Show the app, never say its name. Triggers FOMO → everyone comments "what's the app?" Also makes it feel less like a promotion.

### 2. "Forget" the Link
Say "link below" but don't post it. When the video gets traction, people go crazy asking for the link. Let them cook, then drop it.

### 3. User Input for Personalized Output
Post specific app combinations (e.g., "A – blue eyes, A – blonde hair, C – pale skin = Bright Summer Palette"). Viewers can't see *their* combo → comment to ask for theirs. Exploits desire for personal recognition.

### 4. Intentionally Say Something Wrong
Say a color is green when it's obviously blue. Triggers instant compulsion to correct. People love showcasing their knowledge.

### 5. Write with Typos
Deliberate misspelling triggers the same correction behavior. People can't resist being grammar purists.

### 6. Add an "Irrelevant" Detail
Show Ferrari car keys in a keychain video. The "irrelevant" detail becomes the talking point. Let them be detectives.

### 7. Self-Categorization
"Which one are you?" with zodiac signs, aesthetics, color palettes, etc. Triggers self-identification AND sharing ("this is so you" → sends to friends).

### 8. Share a Locked Feature
Show a feature that requires a code but don't share the code. People flood comments asking for it.

### 9. Cognitive Challenge
Post a quiz/math problem. Triggers desire to showcase skills, gain social recognition, and debate.

### 10. Forget a Category
In astrology/zodiac slideshows, deliberately leave out 1-2 signs. ~1/12 viewers feel excluded and comment "What about me?"

### 11. Reply-To Chain
Reply to user comments in subsequent videos. Others see you responding and comment with their own requests hoping to be featured next.

### 12. Referral Codes
Let users post referral codes in comments. Especially effective targeting audiences without spending money (teens, students).

### 13. Waitlist / Gated Access
Show the app on TikTok but have a waitlist. People get excited, go to App Store, find the waitlist, come back and comment that it's not live yet. Amplifies FOMO.

**The principle:** Creating a viral video is like designing a viral product — details make all the difference.
