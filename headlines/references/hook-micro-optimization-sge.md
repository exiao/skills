# Hook Micro-Optimization (SGE)

Sometimes one word changes everything. Real case study:
- "Top 5 ways to change yourself" → 679K views
- "Top 5 **best** ways to change yourself" → 2.1M views (3x improvement)

**The lesson:** You won't know what works until you've tested it. A/B test single-word variations of your best hooks.

### The Hook + Flip Pattern
Take a hook that works and create its inverse:
- "Habits that make you grow taller" + "Habits that make you shorter" = 57M views across accounts
- The original hook and its flip both perform, doubling your content from one insight

### Dual Hooks
Use two hooks simultaneously in the same video:
- One hook in the text overlay / spoken intro
- A second hook embedded in the visual (app notification, surprising detail, controversial claim)
- Doubles the chance at least one hook lands with any given viewer
