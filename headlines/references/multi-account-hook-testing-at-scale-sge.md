# Multi-Account Hook Testing at Scale (SGE)

Top apps run 10-100+ TikTok accounts simultaneously. Key findings:
- **Same hook, same format, many accounts** = compound distribution
- When a hook works on one account, immediately replicate it across all others
- One person can often manage 4+ accounts posting the same slideshow format
- Top performing videos make up ~40% of total views (power law)
- **Shares > engagement > watch time** in TikTok's algorithm
- Post 2-3x/day per account during testing phase
- Track: which hooks outperform median by 4x+ = scale those

### Content-Market Fit Before Scaling
Find content-market fit first (the hook/format combo that reliably gets views), THEN scale with multi-account + programmatic content. Never scale what doesn't work.
