# Subtitle Rules

The subtitle's job is to give just enough detail to confirm the click is worth it, while deepening the curiosity:
- Include a specific number or data point not in the title
- Foreshadow the payoff without revealing it
- Should feel like the natural "second sentence" after the title

**Good:**
- Title: "I Deleted Half My AI's Prompt. It Got Smarter."
- Subtitle: "Then I tested it 363 times and everything broke. But the failures told me exactly what to add back."

**Bad:**
- Subtitle: "A guide to optimizing AI prompts with automated testing" (boring, no tension)
