# Instagram-Specific Adaptations (SGE)

- **Reels can outperform TikTok** for certain verticals (language learning, faith apps)
- Convert TikTok slideshows to IG by making each slide 1-2 second video frames
- **Carousel posts** work differently than Reels — use for listicles, "your style is," aesthetic content
- Professor/educational content often does better on IG Reels than TikTok
- Cross-post the same hook in both formats but track performance separately
