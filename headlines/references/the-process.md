# The Process

Before writing ANY headline:
1. Write down 3 hooks, 3 objections, 3 visuals (Breakthrough Advertising)
2. Generate 5-10 title variants, sleep on them, kill the ones that don't survive morning review
3. Apply the layered hook test (see below)
4. Check: would someone share this to a group chat?
