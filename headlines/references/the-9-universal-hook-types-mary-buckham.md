# The 9 Universal Hook Types (Mary Buckham)

Every hook raises a question in the reader's mind. The smart writer threads new hooks in before the previous one resolves. Use this taxonomy when crafting titles, subtitles, openers, section hooks, and closers.

### 1. Action Hook
Immediate danger, movement, or consequence. Drops the reader into something already happening.
- "I deleted half my AI's prompt." (what happened next?)
- "Production broke at 11pm." (how'd they fix it?)

### 2. Overpowering Emotion Hook
An emotion so strong the reader needs to know why.
- "Looking back at my losers, the patterns are embarrassingly clear." (what went wrong?)
- "I've never been more excited about something I don't fully understand." (what is it?)

### 3. Surprising Situation Hook
Something the reader didn't expect. Subverts the obvious.
- "The entire oil and gas industry is a rounding error in the S&P 500." (how is that possible?)
- "Our AI couldn't figure out that 45 minutes is less than 60 minutes." (wait what?)

### 4. The Totally Unexpected Hook
A Surprising Situation cranked to 11. The "holy shit" moment.
- "I asked my AI to fix its own prompt. It deleted 48 lines and got smarter." (that can happen??)
- "The worst Coffee Can lost 20%. The best one? 800%." (eight hundred percent?)

### 5. Question(s) Raised Hook
The easiest and most universal hook. Explicit or implied questions.
- Explicit: "What happens when money floods out of a sector for 15 years?"
- Implied: "Most AI investing tools just Google things for you." (so what should they do instead?)

### 6. Unique Character / Perspective Hook
The author or subject is interesting enough to keep reading for.
- "I've been building Coffee Can portfolios for 7 years. Here's every mistake I made."
- "I'm a PM who doesn't code. Here's how I ship AI features."

### 7. Evocative Hook
Sensory, atmospheric, or emotionally rich language that puts the reader *there*. Hardest to pull off in non-fiction but powerful when done right.
- "The spreadsheet was ugly. Rows of red. One column of green that changed everything."
- "3 AM, laptop on my chest, the deploy button staring back at me."

### 8. Foreshadowing / Warning Hook
Hints at complications to come. Creates dread or anticipation.
- "This setup looks perfect. Too perfect." (uh oh)
- "Everything worked in testing." (implying: production was a different story)

### 9. Surprising or Shocking Dialogue Hook
A quote that stops the reader. Works as opening lines or section openers.
- "Kill that baby!" (Sherrilyn Kenyon — contains 8 hooks in 3 words)
- "'Is losing the box covered in the policy or not? If not, why punt to another team?'" (real disagreement)

### Hook Placement (Where Hooks Must Live)

Hooks aren't just for titles. They must appear at these key positions:

| Position | # of Hooks | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| **Title** | 2-3 minimum | This is whether they click at all |
| **Subtitle** | 1-2 | Confirms the click is worth it |
| **First sentence** | 2-3 | Determines if they keep reading |
| **End of first paragraph** | 1-2 | Pulls them past the fold |
| **First sentence of every section** | 1+ | Re-hooks after each heading break |
| **Last sentence of every section** | 1+ | Pulls them into the next section |
| **Final sentence of article** | 2-3 | Determines if they subscribe/share |

**Layer hooks.** A single sentence can contain multiple hook types simultaneously. "I deleted half my AI's prompt. It got smarter." = Action + Surprising Situation + Question Raised (how? why?) = 3 hooks in 10 words.
