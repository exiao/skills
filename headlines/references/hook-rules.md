# Hook Rules

### Power Words First
- ✅ "I deleted", "99 failures", "Production broke", "$0", "Most AI tools"
- ❌ "This is", "Here is", "In this article", "Tips for", "A guide to"

The first 3 words determine if someone reads the rest. Front-load with action verbs, numbers, or contrarian claims.

### The One Job Rule (Breakthrough Advertising)
Your headline has only one job — stop your prospect and compel them to read the second sentence. That's it. Not to summarize. Not to be clever. Just to make them read the next line.

### Curiosity Gap Formulas
- **Knowledge gap**: "I did X so you don't have to" / "I know something you don't"
- **Novelty**: Something unexpected or impossible ("I fixed production from bed")
- **Contrarian**: Challenge assumptions ("Most AI investing tools are lying to you")
- **Personal story with stakes**: Default to real life, make the reader feel the tension
- **Uncertainty**: "I'm doing something crazy and I don't know what will happen"
- **Numbers + specifics**: The specific is more believable than the general ("363 tests" not "hundreds of tests")

### "But, So" Structure
Cross out all the "ands" — add conflict so it builds:
- ❌ "I simplified the prompt and it passed all tests"
- ✅ "I simplified the prompt. It got smarter. But then I tested it 363 times and everything broke."

### 3 Emotions That Make People Act
1. **Frustration** ("I'm done with this crap.") — call out what's broken
2. **Relief** ("This finally fixed it.") — promise the solution
3. **Pride** ("I feel like myself again.") — make them feel smart for reading

### Audience Awareness Levels
Tailor the hook per awareness level:
- **Unaware**: Lead with the problem, not the solution ("Your AI investing app doesn't think.")
- **Problem-aware**: Lead with the contrarian take ("Most AI tools just Google things for you.")
- **Solution-aware**: Lead with proof ("363 tests. 8 failure categories. One sub-agent fixed them all.")
