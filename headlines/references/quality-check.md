# Quality Check

Before publishing any headline, it must pass ALL of these:
1. **Bar test**: Would you say this to a friend at a bar? If it sounds weird spoken aloud, rewrite.
2. **Group chat test** (Signulll): Would someone share this? To virtue signal, say something they can't say themselves, or show off their taste?
3. **Second sentence test**: Does it make you NEED to read the next line?
4. **Specificity test**: Are there concrete numbers, names, or details? ("363 tests" not "many tests")
5. **Morning test**: Write it, sleep on it. If you still like it tomorrow, it's good. 90% you'll hate it and rewrite.
6. **One topic test**: Does it promise exactly one thing? Not two, not a vague umbrella.
7. **Organic test**: Does it sound like content or like an ad? The second it sounds like an ad, it's dead.
