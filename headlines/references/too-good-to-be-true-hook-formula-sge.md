# "Too Good To Be True" Hook Formula (SGE)

The instant reward hack: promise an impossibly large result from impossibly small effort.

### The Formula
**"If you [have pain point], [do tiny thing] and [see massive result]"**

**Examples (with real view counts):**
- "If you have anxiety, listen to this sound and watch what it does to your brain" → 50.2M views, 534K likes, 144K bookmarks
- "How to be fluent in Korean with ONE word" → 1.9M views, 353K likes, 53K bookmarks
- "How to parallel park your car in 5 steps" → 11M views

### Why It Works
It should feel just "impossible" enough to trigger attention. The bigger the promise + the shorter the catch (time, effort) = the better. It's the "too good to be true effect."

### Rules
- Only works if your app/content targets a **real pain point**
- The promise must be *somewhat* believable — not pure fantasy
- Add a time/effort frame: "listen for 55 seconds" (but beware — too long can backfire)
- Stack with engagement: add "what's your favorite?" to spark comments on top
