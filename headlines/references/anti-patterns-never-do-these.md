# Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

- ❌ "A Practical Guide to [X]" — zero tension, zero curiosity
- ❌ "Tips for Better [X]" — generic, forgettable
- ❌ "[Tool Name]: A Review" — nobody cares about your review
- ❌ "Why [X] Matters" — preachy, assumes the reader already cares
- ❌ "The Future of [X]" — overused, vague
- ❌ Starting with "How to" for non-SEO content — fine for search, bad for social
- ❌ Using "Empower", "Leverage", "Unlock", "Revolutionize" — landing page words
- ❌ Clickbait that doesn't deliver — burns trust permanently

### Dramatic Contrast Slop (KILL ON SIGHT)
These are AI's favorite subtitle/headline crutches. They sound punchy but they're templates:
- ❌ "Every X is Y. This one isn't." — formulaic false drama
- ❌ "X isn't Y — it's Z." / "It's not X. It's Y." — fake-deep inversion
- ❌ "Most X. But not this X." — lazy setup/payoff
- ❌ "[Universal claim]. [Exception]." — it's a template, not a thought
- ❌ "The problem isn't X. The problem is Y." — overworn reframe

Instead: just say the actual thing. "AI assistants have been stuck in browser tabs" is better than "Every AI assistant is trapped in a browser tab. This one isn't."
