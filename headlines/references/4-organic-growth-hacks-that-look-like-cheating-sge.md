# 4 Organic Growth Hacks That Look Like Cheating (SGE)

### 1. Fake App Notification as Scroll Bait
Post a slideshow with a dramatic story as a lock screen notification. Place an app notification alongside it. People ignore the story, ask about the app notification. Example: cheating confession slideshow → all comments about the app notification, not the story.

### 2. Watermark Everything
If your app creates content (filters, edits, designs), add a watermark. It's AdSense for high-traffic social: passive exposure that compounds over time.

### 3. Mathematical Bait
Use numbers in hooks with intentional math errors. People love correcting others. "Emailed 200 brands, 110 replied, 90 said yes + 15 said maybe" (= 105, not 110) → 1.5M views, top comments all pointing out the math error. Also works: claim results that seem *too good* for your target audience to believe.

### 4. "Leaked" Discount
Present yourself as an insider "leaking" a non-public discount. Turns regular ad content into an "almost-illegal secret find." People share secrets way more than they share ads.
