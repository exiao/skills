# TikTok Video Hooks (First 1-3 Seconds)

TikTok hooks are different from written hooks. You have ~1 second before someone swipes. The hook is spoken, shown as text overlay, or both. It must create an open loop instantly.

### The Four Laws (validated: 18M views, zero audience, zero budget)

Before applying any formula, these principles determine whether a hook works. A solo dev with no following applied these and hit 18M YouTube Shorts views in 28 days.

**Law 1: The hook is never about your product — it's about the viewer.**
Every video that flopped opened with the product. Every video that went viral opened with something about THEM: what they experience, fear, want, or wonder about themselves.
- ❌ "This app gives you AI stock analysis" → about the product
- ✅ "I let an AI pick my stocks for 30 days" → about an experience the viewer can imagine themselves in

**Law 2: Broad angle beats niche angle.**
Nobody searches for "AI investing app." But FOMO, insider knowledge, outsmarting the system — those are universal. Find the widest possible human experience your topic connects to. If only your target user would watch past second 3, the angle is too narrow.

**Law 3: Create a curiosity gap in second 1, resolve it in the final seconds.**
Tease a result, reveal, or test early. Don't answer it until the end. People don't stay for the content — they stay because they NEED the answer. The footage is just something to watch while they wait. If there's no unresolved tension, there's no watch time.

**Law 4: Every line's only job is to keep them for the next line.**
Information is the reward at the end, not the structure. Anything that explains or teaches without escalating tension gets cut. Read the script aloud — if any line would work as a stopping point, rewrite it so it creates a new question instead.

### The Rules

1. **Text on screen + voice saying something different** doubles retention. Text = the hook, voice = the context.
2. **First frame matters more than first word.** If the visual is boring (person sitting at desk), they swipe before hearing the hook.
3. **Pattern interrupt > clever words.** A weird visual, unexpected cut, or jarring statement beats a well-crafted sentence.
4. **Never start with "Hey guys" or "So today I'm going to..."** — instant swipe.
5. **The hook promises, the next 3 seconds confirm the promise is worth staying for.**

### TikTok Hook Formulas (Ranked)

#### Tier 1 — Highest Retention

**"The exact moment I [unexpected action/realization]..."**
- "The exact moment I realized my portfolio was bleeding money"
- "The exact moment I stopped listening to finance Twitter"
- Why it works: Places viewer at a specific point in time. Creates anticipation for what happened next.

**"I [did X] for [time period]. Here's what happened."**
- "I invested $100/week for 3 years. Here's what happened."
- "I only bought stocks under $10 for a year. Here's what happened."
- Why it works: Specific commitment + time = proof. Viewer needs to see the result.

**"Stop [common action] right now."**
- "Stop checking your portfolio every day."
- "Stop buying ETFs until you watch this."
- Why it works: Direct command creates urgency. Implies they're making a mistake.

**"Nobody talks about [specific thing]."**
- "Nobody talks about what happens after you max out your Roth IRA."
- "Nobody talks about the tax on dividends under 25."
- Why it works: Insider knowledge. Viewer feels they're about to learn a secret.

**[Show result first, then explain]** (visual hook)
- Show the portfolio return screenshot, THEN explain how
- Show the before/after net worth, THEN tell the story
- Why it works: The result IS the hook. No words needed for the first second.

#### Tier 2 — Strong

**"I was today years old when I learned..."**
- "I was today years old when I learned you can lose money on index funds"
- Why it works: Implies common ignorance, viewer doesn't want to be left out.

**"[Number]% of people don't know this about [topic]."**
- "90% of investors don't know this about expense ratios."
- Why it works: Nobody wants to be in the 90%. They stay to check.

**"This is your sign to [action]."**
- "This is your sign to start investing before 25."
- Why it works: Permission + urgency. Works especially well for Gen Z finance.

**"POV: you [relatable situation]"**
- "POV: you finally check your portfolio after 6 months"
- Why it works: Relatability. Viewer sees themselves. Works best with a visual/reaction.

**"If you [have X], watch this."**
- "If you have less than $1,000 invested, watch this."
- "If you're using Robinhood, watch this."
- Why it works: Self-selecting qualifier. People who match HAVE to watch.

#### Tier 3 — Use Sparingly

**"Here's why [contrarian take]."**
- "Here's why I stopped buying index funds."
- Why it works: Contrarian, but overused. Only works if the take is genuinely surprising.

**"The [number] biggest mistakes [audience] make."**
- "The 3 biggest mistakes new investors make."
- Why it works: Listicle structure. Viewer wants to check if they're making the mistakes. Overused format though.

**"What [expert/rich person] knows that you don't."**
- "What Warren Buffett knows about ETFs that you don't."
- Why it works: Authority + knowledge gap. Getting stale.

### Text Overlay Style

- **Max 8 words on screen.** Fewer is better.
- **Bold, high contrast.** White text with black outline or colored background.
- **Put text where eyes go first:** center or top-third of frame.
- **Match the hook to the text, not the other way around.** Write the spoken hook first, then distill it to 4-8 words for the overlay.

Example:
- Spoken: "I invested a hundred dollars every single week for three years and this is what my portfolio looks like now"
- Text overlay: "$100/week for 3 years →"

### Hook Testing Strategy

1. Make the SAME video with 3 different hooks (different first 2 seconds, rest identical)
2. Post each to a different account or at different times
3. Compare retention graphs (TikTok analytics → Content → watch time)
4. The hook with the steepest retention after 3 seconds wins
5. Use that hook pattern for the next 10 videos, then test again

### Adapting Written Hooks to TikTok

Take any hook from the formulas above and apply these filters:
- **Shorten it.** Written hooks can be 15 words. TikTok hooks need to land in 5-8 spoken words.
- **Make it speakable.** Read it aloud. If you stumble, rewrite.
- **Add a visual anchor.** What's on screen while you say it? Green screen? Product? Reaction face? The visual is half the hook.
- **Front-load the emotion.** Written hooks can build tension over a sentence. TikTok hooks need the emotion in the first word: "I lost...", "Stop...", "Nobody...", "The exact moment..."
