# Conversation-Triggering Hooks (SGE)

Hooks that spark debate can go viral 3x with the same format. But **views ≠ conversions**.

**Example:** "Okay but is the realistic amount of $$$…" went viral 3 times for a finance app, massive conversation in comments. But zero app mentions meant zero downloads.

**Two uses for conversation hooks:**
1. **Gauge which topics trigger conversation** → use insights for future product-focused hooks
2. **Warm up accounts** → build targeted audience before pushing harder on conversion content

**Rule:** Always pair conversation hooks with at least a subtle product signal (watermark, second screenshot, app notification overlay).
