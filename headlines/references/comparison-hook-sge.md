# Comparison Hook (SGE)

**"[Well-Known App] for [Your Niche]"** works because it links a new idea to something everyone already knows.

**Examples:**
- "POV: you just found out that the gym's Strava exists" → 200K views for a fitness tracker
- "Duolingo for [X]" — proven format across verticals
- "Cursor for [X]", "Airbnb for [X]"

Works best as a TikTok text overlay or spoken hook in the first 2 seconds.
