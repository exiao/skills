# Faceless Content Formats (SGE)

Not all hooks need a face. These scale infinitely:

### Slideshows
- Best for: couple content, astrology, fashion, study, motivation
- Source images: Pinterest → run through GPT-4o with small tweaks to avoid copyright
- Hook is everything — same slideshow with different hook = completely different performance
- Make in bulk. Repeat winning hooks across accounts.
- IG hack: convert slideshows to video (1-2 seconds per frame) for Reels

### A vs B Split Slideshows
- Cartoon split-screen with contrasting storylines (e.g., "comforting routine" vs "anxiety spiral")
- Strong contrast + storyline continuing across slides = high engagement
- Easily repeatable programmatically and scalable using AI models
- Case study: 4.2M views across 58 slideshows for a screen-blocking app

### Clipping
- Chop and remix existing content into infinite variations
- Build a Discord server of clippers, pay fixed CPM (no views = no cost)
- Provide: asset bank + video guidelines + learnings on what performs
- Competitive but cost-effective once you build a network

### Programmatic Content
- Use tools like MoviePy to generate transitions and animations from code
- Combo: Pinterest images + GPT image API + MoviePy = automated faceless videos
- Only use *after* finding content-market fit — don't scale what doesn't work
