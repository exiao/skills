# SKILL.md Structure

**Frontmatter (YAML):**
- Only two fields supported: `name` and `description`
- Max 1024 characters total
- `name`: Use letters, numbers, and hyphens only (no parentheses, special chars)
- `description`: Third-person, describes ONLY when to use (NOT what it does)
  - Start with "Use when..." to focus on triggering conditions
  - Include specific symptoms, situations, and contexts
  - **NEVER summarize the skill's process or workflow** (see CSO section for why)
  - Keep under 500 characters if possible
