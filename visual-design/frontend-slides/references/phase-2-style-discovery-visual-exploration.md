# Phase 2: Style Discovery (Visual Exploration)

**CRITICAL: This is the "show, don't tell" phase.**

Most people can't articulate design preferences in words. Instead of asking "do you want minimalist or bold?", we generate mini-previews and let them react.

### How Users Choose Presets

Users can select a style in **two ways**:

**Option A: Guided Discovery (Default)**
- User answers mood questions
- Skill generates 3 preview files based on their answers
- User views previews in browser and picks their favorite
- This is best for users who don't have a specific style in mind

**Option B: Direct Selection**
- If user already knows what they want, they can request a preset by name
- Example: "Use the Bold Signal style" or "I want something like Dark Botanical"
- Skip to Phase 3 immediately

**Available Presets:**
| Preset | Vibe | Best For |
|--------|------|----------|
| Bold Signal | Confident, high-impact | Pitch decks, keynotes |
| Electric Studio | Clean, professional | Agency presentations |
| Creative Voltage | Energetic, retro-modern | Creative pitches |
| Dark Botanical | Elegant, sophisticated | Premium brands |
| Notebook Tabs | Editorial, organized | Reports, reviews |
| Pastel Geometry | Friendly, approachable | Product overviews |
| Split Pastel | Playful, modern | Creative agencies |
| Vintage Editorial | Witty, personality-driven | Personal brands |
| Neon Cyber | Futuristic, techy | Tech startups |
| Terminal Green | Developer-focused | Dev tools, APIs |
| Swiss Modern | Minimal, precise | Corporate, data |
| Paper & Ink | Literary, thoughtful | Storytelling |

### Step 2.0: Style Path Selection

First, ask how the user wants to choose their style:

**Question: Style Selection Method**
- Header: "Style"
- Question: "How would you like to choose your presentation style?"
- Options:
  - "Show me options" — Generate 3 previews based on my needs (recommended for most users)
  - "I know what I want" — Let me pick from the preset list directly

**If "Show me options"** → Continue to Step 2.1 (Mood Selection)

**If "I know what I want"** → Show preset picker:

**Question: Pick a Preset**
- Header: "Preset"
- Question: "Which style would you like to use?"
- Options:
  - "Bold Signal" — Vibrant card on dark, confident and high-impact
  - "Dark Botanical" — Elegant dark with soft abstract shapes
  - "Notebook Tabs" — Editorial paper look with colorful section tabs
  - "Pastel Geometry" — Friendly pastels with decorative pills

(If user picks one, skip to Phase 3. If they want to see more options, show additional presets or proceed to guided discovery.)

### Step 2.1: Mood Selection (Guided Discovery)

**Question 1: Feeling**
- Header: "Vibe"
- Question: "What feeling should the audience have when viewing your slides?"
- Options:
  - "Impressed/Confident" — Professional, trustworthy, this team knows what they're doing
  - "Excited/Energized" — Innovative, bold, this is the future
  - "Calm/Focused" — Clear, thoughtful, easy to follow
  - "Inspired/Moved" — Emotional, storytelling, memorable
- multiSelect: true (can choose up to 2)

### Step 2.2: Generate Style Previews

Based on their mood selection, generate **3 distinct style previews** as mini HTML files in a temporary directory. Each preview should be a single title slide showing:

- Typography (font choices, heading/body hierarchy)
- Color palette (background, accent, text colors)
- Animation style (how elements enter)
- Overall aesthetic feel

**Preview Styles to Consider (pick 3 based on mood):**

| Mood | Style Options |
|------|---------------|
| Impressed/Confident | "Bold Signal", "Electric Studio", "Dark Botanical" |
| Excited/Energized | "Creative Voltage", "Neon Cyber", "Split Pastel" |
| Calm/Focused | "Notebook Tabs", "Paper & Ink", "Swiss Modern" |
| Inspired/Moved | "Dark Botanical", "Vintage Editorial", "Pastel Geometry" |

**IMPORTANT: Never use these generic patterns:**
- Purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Inter, Roboto, or system fonts
- Standard blue primary colors
- Predictable hero layouts

**Instead, use distinctive choices:**
- Unique font pairings (Clash Display, Satoshi, Cormorant Garamond, DM Sans, etc.)
- Cohesive color themes with personality
- Atmospheric backgrounds (gradients, subtle patterns, depth)
- Signature animation moments

### Step 2.3: Present Previews

Create the previews in: `.claude-design/slide-previews/`

```
.claude-design/slide-previews/
├── style-a.html   # First style option
├── style-b.html   # Second style option
├── style-c.html   # Third style option
└── assets/        # Any shared assets
```

Each preview file should be:
- Self-contained (inline CSS/JS)
- A single "title slide" showing the aesthetic
- Animated to demonstrate motion style
- ~50-100 lines, not a full presentation

Present to user:
```
I've created 3 style previews for you to compare:

**Style A: [Name]** — [1 sentence description]
**Style B: [Name]** — [1 sentence description]
**Style C: [Name]** — [1 sentence description]

Open each file to see them in action:
- .claude-design/slide-previews/style-a.html
- .claude-design/slide-previews/style-b.html
- .claude-design/slide-previews/style-c.html

Take a look and tell me:
1. Which style resonates most?
2. What do you like about it?
3. Anything you'd change?
```

Then use AskUserQuestion:

**Question: Pick Your Style**
- Header: "Style"
- Question: "Which style preview do you prefer?"
- Options:
  - "Style A: [Name]" — [Brief description]
  - "Style B: [Name]" — [Brief description]
  - "Style C: [Name]" — [Brief description]
  - "Mix elements" — Combine aspects from different styles

If "Mix elements", ask for specifics.
