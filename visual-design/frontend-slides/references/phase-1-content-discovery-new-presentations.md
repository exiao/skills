  - "Conference talk" — Speaking at an event, tech talk, keynote
  - "Internal presentation" — Team updates, strategy meetings, company updates

**Question 2: Slide Count**
- Header: "Length"
- Question: "Approximately how many slides?"
- Options:
  - "Short (5-10)" — Quick pitch, lightning talk
  - "Medium (10-20)" — Standard presentation
  - "Long (20+)" — Deep dive, comprehensive talk

**Question 3: Content**
- Header: "Content"
- Question: "Do you have the content ready, or do you need help structuring it?"
- Options:
  - "I have all content ready" — Just need to design the presentation
  - "I have rough notes" — Need help organizing into slides
  - "I have a topic only" — Need help creating the full outline

If user has content, ask them to share it (text, bullet points, images, etc.).
