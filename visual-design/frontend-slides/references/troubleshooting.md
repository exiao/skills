# Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Fonts not loading:**
- Check Fontshare/Google Fonts URL
- Ensure font names match in CSS

**Animations not triggering:**
- Verify Intersection Observer is running
- Check that `.visible` class is being added

**Scroll snap not working:**
- Ensure `scroll-snap-type` on html/body
- Each slide needs `scroll-snap-align: start`

**Mobile issues:**
- Disable heavy effects at 768px breakpoint
- Test touch events
- Reduce particle count or disable canvas

**Performance issues:**
- Use `will-change` sparingly
- Prefer `transform` and `opacity` animations
- Throttle scroll/mousemove handlers
