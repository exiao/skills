# Core Philosophy

1. **Zero Dependencies** — Single HTML files with inline CSS/JS. No npm, no build tools.
2. **Show, Don't Tell** — People don't know what they want until they see it. Generate visual previews, not abstract choices.
3. **Distinctive Design** — Avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Every presentation should feel custom-crafted.
4. **Production Quality** — Code should be well-commented, accessible, and performant.
5. **Viewport Fitting (CRITICAL)** — Every slide MUST fit exactly within the viewport. No scrolling within slides, ever. This is non-negotiable.
