# Overview

This skill provides guidance for creating sophisticated, interactive data visualisations using d3.js. D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) excels at binding data to DOM elements and applying data-driven transformations to create custom, publication-quality visualisations with precise control over every visual element. The techniques work across any JavaScript environment, including vanilla JavaScript, React, Vue, Svelte, and other frameworks.
