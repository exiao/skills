# Common issues and solutions

**Issue**: Axes not appearing
- Ensure scales have valid domains (check for NaN values)
- Verify axis is appended to correct group
- Check transform translations are correct

**Issue**: Transitions not working
- Call `.transition()` before attribute changes
- Ensure elements have unique keys for proper data binding
- Check that useEffect dependencies include all changing data

**Issue**: Responsive sizing not working
- Use ResizeObserver or window resize listener
- Update dimensions in state to trigger re-render
- Ensure SVG has width/height attributes or viewBox

**Issue**: Performance problems
- Limit number of DOM elements (consider canvas for >1000 items)
- Debounce resize handlers
- Use `.join()` instead of separate enter/update/exit selections
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by checking dependencies
