# Create a Sales Asset

Generate custom sales assets tailored to your prospect, audience, and goals. Supports interactive landing pages, presentation decks, executive one-pagers, and workflow/architecture demos.

## Purpose

Build polished, branded sales assets by gathering four axes of context:
- **(a) The Prospect** — company, contacts, conversations, pain points
- **(b) The Audience** — who's viewing, what they care about
- **(c) The Purpose** — goal of the asset, desired next action
- **(d) The Format** — landing page, deck, one-pager, or workflow demo

Then research, structure, and build a ready-to-share asset.

## Phase 0: Context Collection

### Step 1 — Seller Context
If not already known, ask: "What company/product is this for? What do you sell?" Store for reuse across sessions; on subsequent runs, confirm it's still current.

### Step 2 — Prospect Context
| Required | Field |
|----------|-------|
| ✓ | Company name |
| ✓ | Deal stage (Intro / Discovery / Evaluation / POC / Negotiation / Close) |
| Optional | Key contacts (names, roles), pain points, past conversation materials |

### Step 3 — Audience Context
| Required | Field |
|----------|-------|
| ✓ | Audience type (Executive / Technical / Operations / Mixed) |
| ✓ | Primary concern (ROI / Technical depth / Strategic alignment / Risk / Timeline) |
| Optional | Specific roles, objections to address |

### Step 4 — Purpose
- What's the goal? (Intro / Discovery follow-up / Technical deep-dive / Exec alignment / POC proposal / Close)
- What should the viewer do after seeing this?

### Step 5 — Format Selection
| Format | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Interactive landing page** | Exec alignment, intros, value prop with demos/calculators |
| **Deck-style** | Formal meetings, large audiences, linear narrative |
| **One-pager** | Leave-behinds, executive summaries |
| **Workflow demo** | Technical deep-dives, POC demos with animated flow |

For **workflow demos**, also collect: systems/components involved, step-by-step flow, human touchpoints, example scenario.

## Phase 5: Clarifying Questions (Always Required)

Before building, summarize your plan and confirm:

```
"Here's what I'm planning:
Asset: [Format] for [Prospect]
Audience: [Type + roles]
Goal: [Purpose] → driving toward [desired action]
Key themes: [2-3 main points]"
```

**Standard questions (all formats):**
- "Does this match your vision?"
- "What's the ONE thing this must nail to succeed?"
- "Tone: Bold & confident / Consultative / Technical & precise?"
- "Focused and concise, or comprehensive?"

**Format-specific:**
- Landing page: Which sections matter most? ROI calculator? Competitor positioning?
- Deck: How long? Live presentation or leave-behind?
- One-pager: Single most important message? Print or digital?
- Workflow demo: Confirm components/flow. Realistic data or abstract? Click-through or auto-play?

**Max 2 rounds of clarifying questions.** If still ambiguous, make a reasonable choice and note it.

## Quality Checklist

**Content:** Company name spelled correctly · Leadership names current · Pain points reflect input · No placeholder text · Proof points accurate

**Visual:** Brand colors applied · All text readable (contrast) · Animations smooth · Responsive (if interactive)

**Functional:** All tabs/sections load · Interactive elements work · Workflow animations play · Navigation intuitive · CTA clear

**Professional:** Tone matches audience · Appropriate detail level · No typos · Feels tailored, not templated

## Output Format

A delivered asset file (`.html` for landing pages/demos, or presentation file for decks), plus a brief summary of choices made and any open questions for the next iteration.
