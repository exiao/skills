# Phase 5: Clarifying Questions (REQUIRED)

Before building, always confirm understanding.

### Summarize

```
"Here's what I'm planning:

**Asset**: [Format] for [Prospect]
**Audience**: [Type + roles]
**Goal**: [Purpose] → driving toward [desired action]
**Key themes**: [2-3 main points]

[For workflow demos:]
**Components**: [List]
**Flow**: [Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Step 3] → ..."
```

### Standard Questions (all formats)

- "Does this match your vision?"
- "What's the ONE thing this must nail to succeed?"
- "Tone preference? (Bold & confident / Consultative / Technical & precise)"
- "Focused and concise, or comprehensive?"

### Format-Specific Questions

**Landing page:** Which sections matter most? Include ROI calculator? Competitor positioning?

**Deck:** How long is the presentation? Presenting live or leave-behind?

**One-pager:** Single most important message? Specific proof point? Print or digital?

**Workflow demo:** Confirm components and flow. Realistic sample data or abstract? Click-through or auto-play?

**Max 2 rounds of questions.** If still ambiguous, make a reasonable choice and note it.
