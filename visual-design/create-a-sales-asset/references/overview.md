# Overview

This skill creates professional sales assets by gathering context about:
- **(a) The Prospect** — company, contacts, conversations, pain points
- **(b) The Audience** — who's viewing, what they care about
- **(c) The Purpose** — goal of the asset, desired next action
- **(d) The Format** — landing page, deck, one-pager, or workflow demo

Then it researches, structures, and builds a polished, branded asset ready to share.
