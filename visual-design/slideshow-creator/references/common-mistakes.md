# Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| 1536x1024 (landscape) | Use 1024x1536 (portrait) |
| Font at 5% | Use 6.5% of width |
| Text at bottom | Position at 30% from top |
| Different rooms per slide | Lock architecture in EVERY prompt |
| Labels not reactions | "Wait this is nice??" not "Modern style" |
| Only tracking views | Track conversions — views without revenue = vanity |
| Same hooks forever | Iterate based on data, test new formats weekly |
| No cross-posting | Use Postiz to post everywhere simultaneously |
| Connecting release ID too soon | Wait 2+ hours — TikTok API indexing delay |
| Wrong video connected | Can't overwrite — always verify before connecting |
| `spawnSync ETIMEDOUT` | Exec timeout too short — image gen takes 3-9 min for 6 slides. Use a 10-minute timeout or generate slides one at a time |
