# Hard-Won Lessons (Read This Before You Start)

These come from real experience running this system. Not theory.

**Don't skip the account warmup.** Two weeks of scrolling TikTok like a normal person before you post anything. It feels like wasted time. It's not. Your reach will be 10x higher if the algorithm already understands your account.

**Hooks are everything.** The image quality matters, but the hook determines whether anyone sees the images at all. Spend 80% of your creative energy working with your agent on hooks.

**Make it about other people.** "I redesigned my room" gets nothing. "I showed my landlord what AI thinks and she couldn't believe it" gets 200K views. Always include another person and their reaction. Relatability is everything.

**Post as drafts, add music manually.** Trending sounds genuinely boost reach. It takes 10 seconds and it's worth it every time. Do not let TikTok pick your audio through the API. Browse TikTok for a couple of minutes before publishing and pick whatever audio is blowing up that day.

**Volume beats perfection.** When starting, post 3 times a day. Not every post will hit. That's fine. It's all about letting your agent find their groove.

**Let your agent learn.** Don't micromanage every image. Give feedback when something looks wrong, but let the agent develop its own instincts through the skill files. The compounding effect is the whole point.

**Listen when your agent flags a problem.** If your agent tells you the app needs work, listen. It's watching the funnel every day. It sees patterns you'd miss because you're not looking at the numbers as often. Trust it when it says the issue isn't the content, it's the product.

**Music matters more than you think.** A slideshow with a trending sound will outperform the same slideshow with a random track by 10x. This especially goes for not letting TikTok pick your audio through the API. Do it yourself.
