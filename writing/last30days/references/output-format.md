# Output Format Reference

## Display Sequence

**Display in this EXACT sequence:**

**FIRST - What I learned (based on QUERY_TYPE):**

**If RECOMMENDATIONS** - Show specific things mentioned with sources:
```
🏆 Most mentioned:

[Tool Name] - {n}x mentions
Use Case: [what it does]
Sources: @handle1, @handle2, r/sub, blog.com

[Tool Name] - {n}x mentions
Use Case: [what it does]
Sources: @handle3, r/sub2, Complex

Notable mentions: [other specific things with 1-2 mentions]
```

**CRITICAL for RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- Each item MUST have a "Sources:" line with actual @handles from X posts (e.g., @LONGLIVE47, @ByDobson)
- Include subreddit names (r/hiphopheads) and web sources (Complex, Variety)
- Parse @handles from research output and include the highest-engagement ones
- Format naturally - tables work well for wide terminals, stacked cards for narrow

**If PROMPTING/NEWS/GENERAL** - Show synthesis and patterns:

```
What I learned:

**{Topic 1}** — [1-2 sentences about what people are saying, per @handle or r/sub]

**{Topic 2}** — [1-2 sentences, per @handle or r/sub]

**{Topic 3}** — [1-2 sentences, per @handle or r/sub]

KEY PATTERNS from the research:
1. [Pattern] — per @handle
2. [Pattern] — per r/sub
3. [Pattern] — per @handle
```

✅ All agents reported back!
├─ 🟠 Reddit: {N} threads │ {N} upvotes │ {N} comments
├─ 🔵 X: {N} posts │ {N} likes │ {N} reposts
├─ 🔴 YouTube: {N} videos │ {N} views │ {N} with transcripts
├─ 🌐 Web: {N} pages (supplementary)
└─ 🗣️ Top voices: @{handle1} ({N} likes), @{handle2} │ r/{sub1}, r/{sub2}

```

If Reddit returned 0 threads, write: "├─ 🟠 Reddit: 0 threads (no results this cycle)"
If YouTube returned 0 videos or yt-dlp is not installed, omit the YouTube line entirely.
NEVER use plain text dashes (-) or pipe (|). ALWAYS use ├─ └─ │ and the emoji.

**SELF-CHECK before displaying**: Re-read your "What I learned" section. Does it match what the research ACTUALLY says? If you catch yourself projecting your own knowledge instead of the research, rewrite it.
