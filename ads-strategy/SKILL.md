# Meta Ads Creative Skill

## Purpose

Create Meta ad creative that converts using **research-driven development**, the **6 Elements framework**, and **format fitting** - matching your message to proven ad formats.

**Core Philosophy:** The best Meta ads don't look like ads. Lo-fi > polished. Authentic > produced. Native > interruptive.

## When to Use

- Create ad creative for Meta campaigns
- Develop concepts for retargeting or cold audiences
- Generate multiple variations for A/B testing
- Transform testimonials into ad creative

**Related Skills:**
- `headlines` - Optimizing Primary Text hooks
- `ad-copy` - Direct response copy and brand voice alignment

## Quick Reference

| Task | How |
|------|-----|
| Research phase | Mine testimonials, reviews, competitor ads, Reddit/FB groups |
| Write hooks | Use `headlines` skill — hook is 80% of ad performance |
| Match awareness | Cold → Level 1-2 (problem agitation); Retarget → Level 3-4 |
| Best formats | Notes App, Text-Over-Video, Reddit screenshot (cold traffic) |
| Testing blitz | Launch 20 variants in 4 days, kill bottom 75% by Day 3 |
| Name convention | `[Campaign]_[Format]_[HookType]_V1` |
| Asset production | Nano Banana Pro for cards, screen recordings for demos |

---

## The Value Formula

**Value = Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood / Time Delay x Effort**

Every ad must communicate: (1) What transformation they want, (2) Will it work for them, (3) How long until results, (4) How hard is it.

## The 6 Elements of Ad Creative

Every Meta ad has 6 elements:

| Element | Purpose | Key Guidance |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Media** | Stop the scroll (80% of performance) | iPhone footage > professional. Faces > stock. |
| **Primary Text** | Hook + body copy above media | First 125 chars show before "See More" |
| **Headline** | Short promise below media | 5-8 words max |
| **Description** | Secondary text below headline | Urgency, proof, or clarification |
| **CTA Button** | Action button | "Learn More" (cold) / "Apply Now" (warm) |
| **Page** | Landing destination | Message must match ad |

## The 4-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Research

**Goal:** Understand audience language before writing.

**Sources to mine:**
- Testimonials and reviews (exact language)
- Support tickets and FAQs (objections)
- Reddit/Facebook groups (common questions)
- Competitor ads running 30+ days (proven angles)
- Top organic posts (what resonates)

**Output:** `[Campaign]_Research.md` with 10-20 insights and exact quotes.

### Phase 2: Copywriting

**Goal:** Transform research into compelling copy using proven formulas.

#### Match Awareness Level

| Level | Audience State | Copy Approach |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 - Unaware | Don't know problem exists | Lead with problem agitation |
| 2 - Problem Aware | Know problem, not solutions | Validate + introduce solution |
| 3 - Solution Aware | Know solutions, not you | Differentiate your approach |
| 4 - Product Aware | Know you, haven't acted | Address objections, provide proof |
| 5 - Fully Aware | Ready to act | Make offer irresistible |

**OpenEd typical:** Cold traffic = Level 1-2. Retargeted = Level 3-4. Email list = Level 4-5.

#### Write Hooks First

The hook is 80% of performance. Types: Stated (what you SAY), Visual (what they SEE), Audio (what they HEAR).

> **Load on-demand:** `headlines` skill has 15+ proven hook formulas with examples.

#### Body Copy Formulas

- **PAS** - Problem, Agitate, Solution
- **AIDA** - Attention, Interest, Desire, Action
- **Before-After-Bridge** - Current state, desired state, how to get there
- **Testimonial** - Quote, context, outcome, invitation

**Output:** `[Campaign]_Copy_Variations.md` with 5-10 variations per concept.

> **Load on-demand:** `references/copywriting-formulas.md` for detailed formulas with examples.

### Phase 3: Format Selection

**Goal:** Match copy to the format that amplifies it best.

#### Lo-Fi Native Formats (High Performance)

| Format | Why It Works | Best For |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Notes App | Looks like personal content | Problem-solution, starter packs |
| Text-Over-Video | Story through text sequence | Transformations, permission |
| Reddit/Tweet Screenshot | Discovery energy | Hot takes, personal stories |
| Instagram Comment | Dialogue/Q&A feel | Addressing objections |
| Meme Formats | Culturally native | Contrasts, humor |
| Testimonial Card | Direct social proof | Warm audiences |

#### Format-Audience Matrix

| Audience Temp | Best Formats |
|--------------|--------------|
| Cold | Notes App, Meme, Text-Over-Video, Reddit/Tweet |
| Warm | UGC, Testimonial, Carousel, Before/After |
| Hot | Talking Head, Demo, Direct Offer |

**Output:** Select 3-5 formats per campaign.

### Phase 4: Assembly & Testing

**Goal:** Combine copy + format into complete concepts, then generate variations.

#### Document Each Concept

```markdown
## Ad Concept: [Name]

**Format:** [Selected format]
**Audience:** [Segment] | **Awareness:** [Level 1-5]

**Media:** [Description]
**Primary Text:** [Full copy]
**Headline:** [5-8 words]
**Description:** [Secondary line]
**CTA:** [Button choice]
**Page:** [Landing destination]
```

#### Testing Variations

- **Hook Testing:** Same format, different opening lines (3-5 versions)
- **Format Testing:** Same message, different formats (3 versions)
- **Angle Testing:** Same format, different emotional angles (fear vs hope)

#### 4-Day Rapid Testing Blitz

Don't test 3 creatives over 4 weeks. Test 20 over 4 days:

| Day | Action | Output |
|-----|--------|--------|
| 1 | Generate 20 variations (3-5 styles × 4-6 angles × 2-3 tones) | 20 ready-to-launch ads |
| 2 | Launch all simultaneously, $20-50/day each | All variants live |
| 3 | Kill bottom 75%, identify top 3-5 by CTR + conversion | Winners identified |
| 4 | Generate 10 iterations of winners (new hooks, proof, CTAs) | Second-gen creative live |

Use Nano Banana Pro for visual cards, screen recordings for app demos, Larry for TikTok slideshows. One operator can produce 20-30 variations in a single day at $2-8 per asset vs. $200-800 for traditional UGC.

Run a full blitz at campaign launch, then weekly 10-variation refreshes. New angle blitz every 60-90 days.

> **Load on-demand:** `ad-copy` skill's A/B Testing Framework has the full protocol with statistical significance guidance.

#### Naming Convention

`[Campaign]_[Format]_[Hook Type]_[Variation]`
Example: `OpenEd_NotesApp_StarterPack_V1`

**Output:** `[Campaign]_Ad_Concepts.md` with complete concepts.

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any concept:

**Copy:**
- [ ] Hook stops scroll in first 3 seconds
- [ ] Value formula addressed
- [ ] Awareness level matched
- [ ] Sounds like real person, not corporate

**Visual:**
- [ ] Lo-fi/native feel
- [ ] Text readable on mobile
- [ ] Authentic, not stock

**Strategic:**
- [ ] Landing page message matches
- [ ] Clear next step for viewer

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Skipping research phase** — Writing copy before mining testimonials and reviews. The best copy comes from actual customer language, not invented phrasing.
2. **Polished = better fallacy** — Using stock footage, professional production, or branded graphics when lo-fi/native formats consistently outperform.
3. **Testing too few variants too slowly** — Running 2-3 ads over several weeks instead of the 4-day rapid blitz with 20 variants. Statistical significance requires volume.
4. **Mismatching awareness level** — Sending cold traffic (Level 1-2) straight to a product page instead of problem-agitation copy. Warm retargeting audiences need different hooks than cold audiences.
5. **Landing page mismatch** — Writing a strong ad but pointing to a generic homepage. Message must mirror the specific promise in the ad creative.

## OpenEd-Specific Notes

**Brand Voice:** Warm, empowering, not salesy. "We're here to help" not "Buy now."

**Key Messages:**
- Tuition-free access to resources
- Maintain educational freedom
- Support without judgment

**Testimonials:** Use real quotes verbatim. Match to audience segment. Get permission.

**Compliance:** No outcome guarantees. Follow Meta ad policies.
