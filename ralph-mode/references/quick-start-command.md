# Quick Start Command

Start a Ralph Mode session:

```
"Start Ralph Mode for my project at ~/projects/my-app. I want to implement user authentication with JWT.
```

I will:
1. Create IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with prioritized tasks
2. Spawn sub-agents for iterative implementation
3. Apply backpressure gates (test, lint, typecheck)
4. Track progress and announce completion
