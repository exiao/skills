# When to Use

Use Ralph Mode when:
- Building features that require multiple iterations and refinement
- Working on complex projects with acceptance criteria to validate
- Need automated testing, linting, or typecheck gates
- Want to track progress across many iterations systematically
- Prefer autonomous loops over manual turn-by-turn guidance
