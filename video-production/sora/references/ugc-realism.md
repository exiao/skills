# UGC Realism — Organic Social Shorts

Use this module when the goal is social-native content that feels captured, not produced. The output should read as **a moment that accidentally became content**: one take, no music, no b-roll, posted.

## When to use
- TikTok/Reels/Shorts where authenticity drives retention
- "Overheard" or "caught on camera" style clips
- Creator-style content for brand accounts
- Any brief where "feels real" matters more than "looks good"

## Core realism principles

### 1. Social Context Truth
The person is mid-conversation, replying to someone, thinking out loud, or explaining casually. Never storytelling, presenting, or performing.

### 2. Imperfect Presence
Posture realism, environmental distraction, casual gestures, micro hesitation. No clean delivery, no punchlines, no intentional timing.

### 3. Thought-While-Talking Energy
Filler words ("like", "I don't know", "you ever notice"), pauses, trailing thoughts. Avoid written logic, structured beats, or rehearsed cadence.

### 4. Environmental Participation
The world feels alive: people moving in the background, lighting inconsistency, ambient sound texture, interruption potential.

### 5. No Resolution
End naturally. Not cleverly. Not meaningfully. Just real. Unresolved, interrupted, or observational. Never symmetry, payoff, or joke endings.

## Output structure

When augmenting a prompt for UGC realism, use this template instead of the standard cinematic one:

```
Scene: <time of day, setting, social situation, background motion — lived-in, not staged>
Camera Style: iPhone default. Friend / rested phone / self-filming. Framing imperfections. Never cinematic.
Social Context: <why is this being filmed? friend asked, mid-convo, reacting to something>
Performance Direction: Slightly unsure, observational, half-formed thought. NOT a confidence speech.
Script (<=14 sec): <unplanned, casual phrasing — no punchlines, conclusions, or lessons>
Behavioral Beats: <glance, lean, shrug, look around, micro pause — must feel subconscious>
Ending: <unresolved, interrupted, or observational — never a payoff>
Texture Notes: <ambient sound, lighting imperfection, background motion — goal is "captured, not produced">
Retention Lever: <subtle relatable tension, odd observation, or shared social truth — the psychological hook>
Optional Subtitle: <short, human, not clever>
```

## Style filter

Before finalizing a UGC prompt, check against these:

**Must feel like:** Overheard. Accidental. Socially real.

**Must NOT feel like:** Cinematic tone. Ad tone. Speech cadence. Lesson energy. Written humor.

## Defaults (override standard Sora defaults)

- Duration: `"4"` (14 seconds of dialogue max if extended)
- Size: `1080x1920` (vertical, phone-native)
- Camera: static or slight handheld drift, never smooth tracking
- Lighting: available/ambient only, never styled
- Audio: ambient environment, no music, no sound design

## Prompting notes

- Keep prompts short. Over-specifying kills the organic feel.
- Describe the situation, not the shot. Let imperfection emerge.
- One person, one thought, one moment. No narrative arc.
- If dialogue is included, keep it under 3 sentences. Conversational fragments work better than complete thoughts.
- Avoid any language that implies production: "reveal", "transition", "cut to", "hero shot".
