# Monetization Research

Before creating any content, research what pays. CPM data from brand platforms turns guesswork into a brief.

## The Logic

Don't start with "what should I make?" Start with "what is someone willing to pay me to make?"

A brand paying $670/million views on teeth whitening content has already told you:
- The niche (beauty/health/looksmaxxing)
- The content angle (transformation = before/after)
- The audience (people who want to improve their appearance)
- The conversion hook (visual proof of change)

That's a complete creative brief, for free, from the brand's own budget data.

## Where to Find CPM Data

**Content Rewards** (contentrewards.com)
- Browse by niche/category
- Filter by CPM ($/million views) — prioritize $500+
- Look for brands with physical products (supplement, beauty, wellness) — they convert better than SaaS
- Note the brand name, CPM, and any format restrictions

**TikTok Creator Marketplace**
- Brands post their requirements directly
- Check "open collaboration" listings for CPM and content type

**TikTok Series / Pulse**
- Premium ad inventory — brands pay more for content adjacent to trending topics
- Use to validate that a niche is actively monetized

## Research Workflow

1. Open Content Rewards → browse by niche → sort by CPM descending
2. Pick 3-5 candidate brands in adjacent niches (teeth whitening, skincare, fitness, hair)
3. For each, note: CPM, format preference (slideshow vs video), brand aesthetic
4. Search TikTok for that brand's hashtag — what formats are getting views?
5. Pick the niche with the highest CPM that also has proven organic formats on TikTok

## Matching Niche to Format

| Niche | CPM Range | Best Format | Why |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Teeth whitening / oral care | $500-800/M | Before/after slideshow | Visual transformation is undeniable |
| Skincare | $400-700/M | Before/after slideshow | Same — skin is visual |
| Haircare / looksmaxxing | $300-600/M | Before/after + tips | Transformation + aspirational |
| Supplements / weight loss | $200-500/M | Results + lifestyle | Social proof driven |
| Fitness | $150-400/M | Routine + results | Instructional converts |

Before/after slideshows index highest across beauty/health niches because:
- Two images = complete story
- No narration required
- Result is immediately legible at a glance
- Drives saves (people come back to reference)

## Before/After as a Format

The before/after is not just a creative choice — it's a monetization format. It works because:
1. The transformation is the hook (no text needed to explain)
2. It creates implicit product credit (what changed between slides?)
3. It bypasses skepticism — visual evidence > testimonial copy

**Production inputs:**
- Find a reference image on Pinterest (person in target niche)
- Use ChatGPT or Claude to generate a detailed NB2/image-gen prompt that adds the "before" state (e.g., yellow teeth, uneven skin)
- Generate 3-5 variations with different backgrounds or lighting
- Repeat for the "after" state — same person, same composition, improved condition
- Pair as slides in ReelFarm

**Variation strategy:** Same transformation, different backgrounds (outdoor, bathroom mirror, natural light). This creates 3-5 posts from a single creative session that look distinct in a feed.

## Multi-Account Distribution Math

Posting volume is the skill, not the prompt. One account is a test. Ten accounts is a system.

| Accounts | Posts/day | Monthly posts | Expected reach at 10K avg |
|----------|-----------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | 2 | 60 | 600K views/mo |
| 5 | 2 | 300 | 3M views/mo |
| 10 | 2 | 600 | 6M views/mo |

At $670/million views on a teeth whitening brand, 10 accounts posting 2x/day = ~$4,000/month in brand payments, plus the accounts themselves become distribution assets.

**Account warmup:** New accounts should post 5-7 organic (non-branded) pieces before introducing brand content. Avoids early shadowban signals.

**Content differentiation:** Rotate backgrounds, lighting, and text overlays across accounts — same transformation, visually distinct posts. Platforms flag duplicate content; variation is protection.

## Integration with Feedback Loop

The daily analytics cron (see `the-feedback-loop`) should track views-per-account, not just total views. This surfaces which accounts are gaining traction and which need warmup or content rotation.

When a brand's CPM drops (check Content Rewards monthly), rotate the niche brief. Don't wait for revenue to drop — watch the rates proactively.
