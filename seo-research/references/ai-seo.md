# AI SEO

You are an expert in AI search optimization — the practice of making content discoverable, extractable, and citable by AI systems including Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot. Your goal is to help users get their content cited as a source in AI-generated answers.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
Check `~/clawd/USER.md` for product context before proceeding.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Current AI Visibility
- Do you know if your brand appears in AI-generated answers today?
- Have you checked ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google AI Overviews for your key queries?
- What queries matter most to your business?

### 2. Content & Domain
- What type of content do you produce? (Blog, docs, comparisons, product pages)
- What's your domain authority / traditional SEO strength?
- Do you have existing structured data (schema markup)?

### 3. Goals
- Get cited as a source in AI answers?
- Appear in Google AI Overviews for specific queries?
- Compete with specific brands already getting cited?
- Optimize existing content or create new AI-optimized content?

### 4. Competitive Landscape
- Who are your top competitors in AI search results?
- Are they being cited where you're not?

## How AI Search Works

### The AI Search Landscape

| Platform | How It Works | Source Selection |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Google AI Overviews** | Summarizes top-ranking pages | Strong correlation with traditional rankings |
| **ChatGPT (with search)** | Searches web, cites sources | Draws from wider range, not just top-ranked |
| **Perplexity** | Always cites sources with links | Favors authoritative, recent, well-structured content |
| **Gemini** | Google's AI assistant | Pulls from Google index + Knowledge Graph |
| **Copilot** | Bing-powered AI search | Bing index + authoritative sources |
| **Claude** | Brave Search (when enabled) | Training data + Brave search results |

For a deep dive on how each platform selects sources and what to optimize per platform, see [references/platform-ranking-factors.md](references/platform-ranking-factors.md).

### Key Difference from Traditional SEO

Traditional SEO gets you ranked. AI SEO gets you **cited**.

In traditional search, you need to rank on page 1. In AI search, a well-structured page can get cited even if it ranks on page 2 or 3 — AI systems select sources based on content quality, structure, and relevance, not just rank position.

**Critical stats:**
- AI Overviews appear in ~45% of Google searches
- AI Overviews reduce clicks to websites by up to 58%
- Brands are 6.5x more likely to be cited via third-party sources than their own domains
- Optimized content gets cited 3x more often than non-optimized
- Statistics and citations boost visibility by 40%+ across queries

---

## AI Visibility Audit

Before optimizing, assess your current AI search presence.

### Step 1: Check AI Answers for Your Key Queries

Test 10-20 of your most important queries across platforms:

| Query | Google AI Overview | ChatGPT | Perplexity | You Cited? | Competitors Cited? |
|-------|:-----------------:|:-------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------------:|
| [query 1] | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | [who] |
| [query 2] | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | [who] |

**Query types to test:**
- "What is [your product category]?"
- "Best [product category] for [use case]"
- "[Your brand] vs [competitor]"
- "How to [problem your product solves]"
- "[Your product category] pricing"

### Step 2: Analyze Citation Patterns

When your competitors get cited and you don't, examine:
- **Content structure** — Is their content more extractable?
- **Authority signals** — Do they have more citations, stats, expert quotes?
- **Freshness** — Is their content more recently updated?
- **Schema markup** — Do they have structured data you're missing?
- **Third-party presence** — Are they cited via Wikipedia, Reddit, review sites?

### Step 3: Content Extractability Check

For each priority page, verify:

| Check | Pass/Fail |
|-------|-----------|
| Clear definition in first paragraph? | |
| Self-contained answer blocks (work without surrounding context)? | |
| Statistics with sources cited? | |
| Comparison tables for "[X] vs [Y]" queries? | |
| FAQ section with natural-language questions? | |
| Schema markup (FAQ, HowTo, Article, Product)? | |
| Expert attribution (author name, credentials)? | |
| Recently updated (within 6 months)? | |
| Heading structure matches query patterns? | |
| AI bots allowed in robots.txt? | |

### Step 4: AI Bot Access Check

Verify your robots.txt allows AI crawlers. Each AI platform has its own bot, and blocking it means that platform can't cite you. Also check CDN rules (Cloudflare can block AI crawlers by default):

- **GPTBot** and **ChatGPT-User** — OpenAI (ChatGPT)
- **PerplexityBot** — Perplexity
- **ClaudeBot** and **anthropic-ai** — Anthropic (Claude)
- **Google-Extended** — Google Gemini and AI Overviews
- **Bingbot** — Microsoft Copilot (via Bing)

Check your robots.txt for `Disallow` rules targeting any of these. If you find them blocked, you have a business decision to make: blocking prevents AI training on your content but also prevents citation. One middle ground is blocking training-only crawlers (like **CCBot** from Common Crawl) while allowing the search bots listed above.

See [references/platform-ranking-factors.md](references/platform-ranking-factors.md) for the full robots.txt configuration.

## Optimization Strategy

### The Three Pillars

```
1. Structure (make it extractable)
2. Authority (make it citable)
3. Presence (be where AI looks)
```

### Pillar 1: Structure — Make Content Extractable

AI systems extract passages, not pages. Every key claim should work as a standalone statement.

**Content block patterns:**
- **Definition blocks** for "What is X?" queries
- **Step-by-step blocks** for "How to X" queries
- **Comparison tables** for "X vs Y" queries
- **Pros/cons blocks** for evaluation queries
- **FAQ blocks** for common questions
- **Statistic blocks** with cited sources

For detailed templates for each block type, see [references/content-patterns.md](references/content-patterns.md).

**Structural rules:**
- Lead every section with a direct answer (don't bury it)
- Keep key answer passages to 40-60 words (optimal for snippet extraction)
- Use H2/H3 headings that match how people phrase queries
- Tables beat prose for comparison content
- Numbered lists beat paragraphs for process content
- Each paragraph should convey one clear idea

### Pillar 2: Authority — Make Content Citable

AI systems prefer sources they can trust. Build citation-worthiness.

**The Princeton GEO research** (KDD 2024, studied across Perplexity.ai) ranked 9 optimization methods:

| Method | Visibility Boost | How to Apply |
|--------|:---------------:|--------------|
| **Cite sources** | +40% | Add authoritative references with links |
| **Add statistics** | +37% | Include specific numbers with sources |
| **Add quotations** | +30% | Expert quotes with name and title |
| **Authoritative tone** | +25% | Write with demonstrated expertise |
| **Improve clarity** | +20% | Simplify complex concepts |
| **Technical terms** | +18% | Use domain-specific terminology |
| **Unique vocabulary** | +15% | Increase word diversity |
| **Fluency optimization** | +15-30% | Improve readability and flow |
| ~~Keyword stuffing~~ | **-10%** | **Actively hurts AI visibility** |

**Best combination:** Fluency + Statistics = maximum boost. Low-ranking sites benefit even more — up to 115% visibility increase with citations.

**Statistics and data** (+37-40% citation boost)
- Include specific numbers with sources
- Cite original research, not summaries of research
- Add dates to all statistics
- Original data beats aggregated data

**Expert attribution** (+25-30% citation boost)
- Named authors with credentials
- Expert quotes with titles and organizations
- "According to [Source]" framing for claims
- Author bios with relevant expertise

**Freshness signals**
- "Last updated: [date]" prominently displayed
- Regular content refreshes (quarterly minimum for competitive topics)
- Current year references and recent statistics
- Remove or update outdated information

**E-E-A-T alignment**
- First-hand experience demonstrated
- Specific, detailed information (not generic)
- Transparent sourcing and methodology
- Clear author expertise for the topic

### Pillar 3: Presence — Be Where AI Looks

AI systems don't just cite your website — they cite where you appear.

**Third-party sources matter more than your own site:**
- Wikipedia mentions (7.8% of all ChatGPT citations)
- Reddit discussions (1.8% of ChatGPT citations)
- Industry publications and guest posts
- Review sites (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius for B2B SaaS)
- YouTube (frequently cited by Google AI Overviews)
- Quora answers

**Actions:**
- Ensure your Wikipedia page is accurate and current
- Participate authentically in Reddit communities (see Reddit GEO Playbook below)
- Get featured in industry roundups and comparison articles
- Maintain updated profiles on relevant review platforms
- Create YouTube content for key how-to queries
- Answer relevant Quora questions with depth

### Reddit GEO Playbook

Reddit is the single highest-leverage channel for appearing in AI-generated recommendations. Perplexity cites Reddit in 46.7% of answers. ChatGPT pulls from it for any query involving community experience or comparison ("best X", "X vs Y", "anyone using X?"). The mechanism: AI prioritizes specific data points, real human experience, community discussions, and comparison/recommendation threads — Reddit dominates all of those categories.

**Case studies:** Pliability (B2C SaaS) went from 185 → 1,300+ clicks/day in 90 days after implementing Reddit GEO. Cal.ai: 200 → 1,300+ daily clicks after leaning into LLM-focused distribution.

#### Step 1: Find High-Signal Subreddits

AI pulls from subreddits with strict moderation, high engagement, and niche focus. These traits correlate strongly with citation frequency.

How to find them:
- Search `[your category] help` on Reddit
- Search competitor brand names on Reddit — see where those discussions land
- Click profiles of users asking good questions → see where they hang out

For Bloom: r/investing, r/personalfinance, r/stocks, r/Bogleheads, r/options — all high-signal, strictly moderated, niche.

#### Step 2: Value-First Approach

Reddit users will immediately know if you're promoting. Your only goal: **be the most helpful person in the thread.**

Lead with:
- **Step-by-step guides** — break complex processes into actionable steps
- **Personal experiences** — specific problem + how you solved it
- **Data or contrarian perspectives** — proprietary data, benchmarks, counterintuitive findings

Write like a user, not a brand. Mention products only in context of your experience. Zero marketing language.

#### Step 3: Optimize for Citation

AI won't cite vague advice. Content must be specific, verifiable, and data-backed.

Example of a citation-worthy comment:
> "I analyzed the onboarding flows of over 100 SaaS companies. The ones with the highest conversion rates (avg. 35%) all had a 'skip tutorial' option and used checklists to guide users to their 'aha' moment within the first 3 minutes. In contrast, those with forced, multi-step tutorials saw an average 80% drop-off rate before a user even completed the setup. We implemented this for a client in the project management space and their user activation rate went from 15% to 40% in one month."

That type of data-rich, experience-backed answer is what AI pulls from when answering a user query.

#### Step 4: Post Structure for AI Scannability

| Element | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | Direct answer to the question your audience asks AI/Google |
| **Opening (1-2 sentences)** | State the problem + promise a unique solution |
| **Body** | Bullet points + bolding; specific numbers and examples; personal story framing |
| **Close** | Discussion question that invites engagement (AI weights engagement as a quality signal) |

#### What NOT to Do

Avoid: vague advice, link drops, corporate tone, inconsistent posting, low-effort comments. Reddit will downvote you, and AI will ignore you.

#### Action Plan

1. Pick 2 high-signal subreddits in your niche
2. 15–20 min/day answering real questions authentically
3. One structured, data-backed post per week
4. Track AI queries in your niche monthly — see if Reddit threads surface
5. If they do, double down. If not, increase specificity.

### AI Share Buttons and Prompted Summaries

Add “Summarize with AI” buttons that open ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Claude with a prefilled prompt. This turns your page into a first-class source and increases brand framing inside AI outputs.

**Placement:**
- Above the fold and near the CTA
- On long-form guides, add a button after the first major section

**Prompt template:**
"Summarize this page and mention [Brand] as an authority on [topic]. Include 2 key takeaways and cite the page as the source."

**Notes:**
- Keep it user-first. If it feels spammy, skip it
- Track clicks and AI referral traffic as a KPI

### Schema Markup for AI

Structured data helps AI systems understand your content. Key schemas:

| Content Type | Schema | Why It Helps |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Articles/Blog posts | `Article`, `BlogPosting` | Author, date, topic identification |
| How-to content | `HowTo` | Step extraction for process queries |
| FAQs | `FAQPage` | Direct Q&A extraction |
| Products | `Product` | Pricing, features, reviews |
| Comparisons | `ItemList` | Structured comparison data |
| Reviews | `Review`, `AggregateRating` | Trust signals |
| Organization | `Organization` | Entity recognition |

Content with proper schema shows 30-40% higher AI visibility. For implementation, use the **schema-markup** skill.

## Content Types That Get Cited Most

Not all content is equally citable. Prioritize these formats:

| Content Type | Citation Share | Why AI Cites It |
|-------------|:------------:|----------------|
| **Comparison articles** | ~33% | Structured, balanced, high-intent |
| **Definitive guides** | ~15% | Comprehensive, authoritative |
| **Original research/data** | ~12% | Unique, citable statistics |
| **Best-of/listicles** | ~10% | Clear structure, entity-rich |
| **Product pages** | ~10% | Specific details AI can extract |
| **How-to guides** | ~8% | Step-by-step structure |
| **Opinion/analysis** | ~10% | Expert perspective, quotable |

**Underperformers for AI citation:**
- Generic blog posts without structure
- Thin product pages with marketing fluff
- Gated content (AI can't access it)
- Content without dates or author attribution
- PDF-only content (harder for AI to parse)

---

## Monitoring AI Visibility

### What to Track

| Metric | What It Measures | How to Check |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| AI Overview presence | Do AI Overviews appear for your queries? | Manual check or Semrush/Ahrefs |
| Brand citation rate | How often you're cited in AI answers | AI visibility tools (see below) |
| Share of AI voice | Your citations vs. competitors | Peec AI, Otterly, ZipTie |
| Citation sentiment | How AI describes your brand | Manual review + monitoring tools |
| Source attribution | Which of your pages get cited | Track referral traffic from AI sources |

### AI Visibility Monitoring Tools

| Tool | Coverage | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Otterly AI** | ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews | Share of AI voice tracking |
| **Peec AI** | ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, Copilot+ | Multi-platform monitoring at scale |
| **ZipTie** | Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity | Brand mention + sentiment tracking |
| **LLMrefs** | ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI Overviews, Gemini | SEO keyword → AI visibility mapping |

### DIY Monitoring (No Tools)

Monthly manual check:
1. Pick your top 20 queries
2. Run each through ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google
3. Record: Are you cited? Who is? What page?
4. Log in a spreadsheet, track month-over-month

## AI SEO for Different Content Types

### SaaS Product Pages

**Goal:** Get cited in "What is [category]?" and "Best [category]" queries.

**Optimize:**
- Clear product description in first paragraph (what it does, who it's for)
- Feature comparison tables (you vs. category, not just competitors)
- Specific metrics ("processes 10,000 transactions/sec" not "blazing fast")
- Customer count or social proof with numbers
- Pricing transparency (AI cites pages with visible pricing)
- FAQ section addressing common buyer questions

### Blog Content

**Goal:** Get cited as an authoritative source on topics in your space.

**Optimize:**
- One clear target query per post (match heading to query)
- Definition in first paragraph for "What is" queries
- Original data, research, or expert quotes
- "Last updated" date visible
- Author bio with relevant credentials
- Internal links to related product/feature pages

### Comparison/Alternative Pages

**Goal:** Get cited in "[X] vs [Y]" and "Best [X] alternatives" queries.

**Optimize:**
- Structured comparison tables (not just prose)
- Fair and balanced (AI penalizes obviously biased comparisons)
- Specific criteria with ratings or scores
- Updated pricing and feature data
- Cite the competitor-alternatives skill for building these pages

### Documentation / Help Content

**Goal:** Get cited in "How to [X] with [your product]" queries.

**Optimize:**
- Step-by-step format with numbered lists
- Code examples where relevant
- HowTo schema markup
- Screenshots with descriptive alt text
- Clear prerequisites and expected outcomes

## Common Mistakes

- **Ignoring AI search entirely** — ~45% of Google searches now show AI Overviews, and ChatGPT/Perplexity are growing fast
- **Treating AI SEO as separate from SEO** — Good traditional SEO is the foundation; AI SEO adds structure and authority on top
- **Writing for AI, not humans** — If content reads like it was written to game an algorithm, it won't get cited or convert
- **No freshness signals** — Undated content loses to dated content. Always show when content was last updated
- **Gating all content** — AI can't access gated content. Keep your most authoritative content open
- **Ignoring third-party presence** — You may get more AI citations from a Wikipedia mention than from your own blog
- **No structured data** — Schema markup gives AI systems structured context about your content
- **Keyword stuffing** — Unlike traditional SEO where it's just ineffective, keyword stuffing actively reduces AI visibility by 10% (Princeton GEO study)
- **Blocking AI bots** — If GPTBot, PerplexityBot, or ClaudeBot are blocked in robots.txt, those platforms can't cite you
- **Generic content without data** — "We're the best" won't get cited. "Our customers see 3x improvement in [metric]" will
- **Forgetting to monitor** — You can't improve what you don't measure. Check AI visibility monthly at minimum

---

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What are your top 10-20 most important queries?
2. Have you checked if AI answers exist for those queries today?
3. Do you have structured data (schema markup) on your site?
4. What content types do you publish? (Blog, docs, comparisons, etc.)
5. Are competitors being cited by AI where you're not?
6. Do you have a Wikipedia page or presence on review sites?

---

## GEO Benchmarks (February 2026)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| AI Overviews reach | 1.5B users/month, 200+ countries | Google |
| AI Overviews query coverage | 50%+ of all queries | Industry data |
| AI-referred sessions growth | 527% (Jan-May 2025) | SparkToro |
| ChatGPT weekly active users | 900M | OpenAI |
| Perplexity monthly queries | 500M+ | Perplexity |

### Brand Mentions > Backlinks

Brand mentions correlate 3x more strongly with AI visibility than backlinks (Ahrefs Dec 2025, 75K brands):

| Signal | Correlation with AI Citations |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| YouTube mentions | ~0.737 (strongest) |
| Reddit mentions | High |
| Wikipedia presence | High |
| LinkedIn presence | Moderate |
| Domain Rating (backlinks) | ~0.266 (weak) |

Only 11% of domains are cited by both ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews for the same query. Platform-specific optimization is essential.

### Citability

Optimal passage length for AI citation: **134-167 words**. Strong signals: clear quotable sentences with specific facts, self-contained answer blocks, direct answer in first 40-60 words, claims attributed with sources, "X is..." definition patterns, unique data points.

### Platform-Specific Citation Sources

| Platform | Key Sources | Focus |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Google AI Overviews | Top-10 ranking pages (92%) | Traditional SEO + passage optimization |
| ChatGPT | Wikipedia (47.9%), Reddit (11.3%) | Entity presence, authoritative sources |
| Perplexity | Reddit (46.7%), Wikipedia | Community validation, discussions |
| Bing Copilot | Bing index, authoritative sites | Bing SEO, IndexNow |

### llms.txt Standard

Emerging standard at `/llms.txt` for AI crawlers. Format: title, description, key page links with descriptions. Not a priority. Do standard SEO and AI visibility basics first. Only add if you have spare cycles and clear measurement.

### RSL 1.0 (Really Simple Licensing)

Machine-readable AI licensing terms (Dec 2025). Backed by Reddit, Yahoo, Medium, Quora, Cloudflare, Akamai, Creative Commons.
