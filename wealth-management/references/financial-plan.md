# Financial Plan

Build or update a comprehensive financial plan covering retirement projections, education funding, estate planning, and cash flow analysis.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Client Profile

Gather or confirm:
- **Demographics**: Age, spouse age, dependents, life expectancy assumptions
- **Employment**: Current income, expected raises, retirement age target
- **Accounts**: All investment accounts with balances and asset allocation
- **Income sources**: Salary, bonuses, rental income, Social Security, pensions
- **Expenses**: Current annual spending, expected changes
- **Liabilities**: Mortgage, student loans, other debt
- **Insurance**: Life, disability, LTC, health
- **Estate**: Wills, trusts, beneficiary designations, gifting strategy

### Step 2: Cash Flow Analysis

| Year | Age | Gross Income | Taxes | Living Expenses | Savings | Net Cash Flow |
|------|-----|-------------|-------|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| | | | | | | |

Key assumptions:
- Inflation rate: 2.5-3%
- Tax rate (marginal and effective)
- Savings rate and account types (pre-tax, Roth, taxable)

### Step 3: Retirement Projections

**Accumulation Phase:**
- Current portfolio value
- Annual contributions
- Expected return by asset class
- Monte Carlo: probability of success at various spending levels

**Distribution Phase:**
- Required annual spending in retirement (inflation-adjusted)
- Social Security start age and benefit
- Portfolio withdrawal rate
- RMDs

**Key Output:**
- Projected portfolio value at retirement
- Sustainable withdrawal rate
- Probability of not running out of money (target >85%)
- Scenarios: retire early, market downturn, higher spending

### Step 4: Goal-Specific Analysis

#### Education Funding
- Children's ages and target college start
- Current 529 balances
- Required monthly savings to reach goal

#### Estate Planning
- Estate tax exposure (federal and state)
- Trust structures in place
- Gifting strategy (annual exclusion, lifetime exemption)
- Charitable giving plans

#### Risk Management
- Life insurance needs analysis
- Disability insurance adequacy
- Long-term care planning

### Step 5: Scenario Modeling

| Scenario | Probability of Success | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Base case | | |
| Retire 2 years early | | |
| 20% market drop in Year 1 | | |
| Higher spending (+20%) | | |
| Long-term care event | | |

### Step 6: Recommendations

Prioritized action items:
1. Savings rate changes
2. Asset allocation adjustments
3. Tax optimization (Roth conversions, TLH, asset location)
4. Insurance gaps
5. Estate document updates

### Step 7: Output

- Financial plan document (15-25 pages, Word/PDF)
- Cash flow projection (Excel)
- Retirement projection charts
- Scenario comparison table
- Action item checklist

## Important Notes

- Plans are living documents — review annually or after major life events
- Be conservative with return assumptions
- Model Social Security at 62, 67, and 70
- Stress-test the plan — a plan that only works in base case isn't good
- Always comply with suitability/fiduciary standards
