# Investment Proposal

Create professional investment proposals for prospective clients covering the firm's approach, proposed allocation, expected outcomes, and fee structure.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Prospect Context

Gather:
- **Prospect name** and household details
- **Current situation**: Existing advisor? Self-directed? What prompted the meeting?
- **Assets**: Estimated AUM, account types, current holdings
- **Goals**: Retirement, growth, income, education, estate
- **Risk tolerance**: Conservative, moderate, aggressive
- **Constraints**: ESG, concentrated stock, liquidity needs
- **Fee sensitivity**: What are they paying now?
- **Competition**: Who else are they considering?

### Step 2: Proposal Structure

**I. About Our Firm** (1 page)
- Overview, history, AUM
- Investment philosophy
- Team bios relevant to this client
- Client service model

**II. Understanding Your Needs** (1 page)
- Restate their goals — show you listened
- Key planning considerations from discovery

**III. Proposed Investment Strategy** (2-3 pages)

| Asset Class | Allocation | Vehicle | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| | | | |

- How allocation maps to goals and risk tolerance
- Investment vehicles (ETFs, funds, individual securities, alternatives)
- Tax-aware strategy

**IV. Expected Outcomes** (1-2 pages)
- Projected growth scenarios (conservative, moderate, optimistic)
- Monte Carlo probability of meeting goals
- Risk metrics (max drawdown, volatility)
- Comparison to current portfolio

**V. Fee Structure** (1 page)
- Advisory fee schedule
- Underlying fund expenses
- Total all-in cost
- Value proposition

**VI. Getting Started** (1 page)
- Account opening process
- Transfer timeline
- Transition plan
- First 90 days expectations
- Next steps

### Step 3: Customization

- Match tone to prospect type
- Address concentrated stock directly if present
- If comparing to robo-advisors, emphasize planning and relationship value

### Step 4: Output

- PowerPoint (12-15 slides) with firm branding
- PDF leave-behind
- One-page summary for follow-up email

## Important Notes

- Must feel personalized, not templated — reference their specific situation
- Don't oversell performance — set realistic expectations, emphasize process
- Always include disclaimers (projections are hypothetical, past performance, etc.)
- The transition plan matters — clients fear disruption of switching advisors
- Follow up within 48 hours with clear next steps
- Compliance must review before presenting to prospects
