# last30days v2.1: Research Any Topic from the Last 30 Days

Research ANY topic across Reddit, X, YouTube, and the web. Surface what people are actually discussing, recommending, and debating right now.

## Quick Reference

| Task | How |
|------|-----|
| Start research | `last30 [topic]` |
| Specify target tool | `last30 [topic] for [tool]` |
| Get recommendations | `last30 best [topic]` or `last30 top [topic]` |
| Get current news/updates | `last30 what's happening with [topic]` |
| Trigger alias | Also responds to `last30` as a command prefix |
| Key sources | Reddit, X/Twitter, YouTube, web search |
| Output | Expert summary + copy-paste-ready prompts for target tool |

## CRITICAL: Parse User Intent

Before doing anything, parse the user's input for:

1. **TOPIC**: What they want to learn about (e.g., "web app mockups", "Claude Code skills", "image generation")
2. **TARGET TOOL** (if specified): Where they'll use the prompts (e.g., "Nano Banana Pro", "ChatGPT", "Midjourney")
3. **QUERY TYPE**: What kind of research they want:
   - **PROMPTING** - "X prompts", "prompting for X", "X best practices" → User wants to learn techniques and get copy-paste prompts
   - **RECOMMENDATIONS** - "best X", "top X", "what X should I use", "recommended X" → User wants a LIST of specific things
   - **NEWS** - "what's happening with X", "X news", "latest on X" → User wants current events/updates
   - **GENERAL** - anything else → User wants broad understanding of the topic

Common patterns:
- `[topic] for [tool]` → "web mockups for Nano Banana Pro" → TOOL IS SPECIFIED
- `[topic] prompts for [tool]` → "UI design prompts for Midjourney" → TOOL IS SPECIFIED
- Just `[topic]` → "iOS design mockups" → TOOL NOT SPECIFIED, that's OK
- "best [topic]" or "top [topic]" → QUERY_TYPE = RECOMMENDATIONS
- "what are the best [topic]" → QUERY_TYPE = RECOMMENDATIONS

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT ask about target tool before research.**
- If tool is specified in the query, use it
- If tool is NOT specified, run research first, then ask AFTER showing results

**Store these variables:**
- `TOPIC = [extracted topic]`
- `TARGET_TOOL = [extracted tool, or "unknown" if not specified]`
- `QUERY_TYPE = [RECOMMENDATIONS | NEWS | HOW-TO | GENERAL]`

**DISPLAY your parsing to the user.** Before running any tools, output:

```
I'll research {TOPIC} across Reddit, X, and the web to find what's been discussed in the last 30 days.

Parsed intent:
- TOPIC = {TOPIC}
- TARGET_TOOL = {TARGET_TOOL or "unknown"}
- QUERY_TYPE = {QUERY_TYPE}

Research typically takes 2-8 minutes (niche topics take longer). Starting now.
```

If TARGET_TOOL is known, mention it in the intro: "...to find {QUERY_TYPE}-style content for use in {TARGET_TOOL}."

This text MUST appear before you call any tools. It confirms to the user that you understood their request.

---

## Research Execution

**Step 1: Run the research script (FOREGROUND — do NOT background this)**

**CRITICAL: Run this command in the FOREGROUND with a 5-minute timeout. Do NOT use run_in_background. The full output contains Reddit, X, AND YouTube data that you need to read completely.**

```bash
# Find skill root — works in repo checkout, Claude Code, or Codex install
for dir in \
  "." \
  "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}" \
  "$HOME/.claude/skills/last30days" \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/last30days" \
  "$HOME/.codex/skills/last30days"; do
  [ -n "$dir" ] && [ -f "$dir/scripts/last30days.py" ] && SKILL_ROOT="$dir" && break
done

if [ -z "${SKILL_ROOT:-}" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Could not find scripts/last30days.py" >&2
  exit 1
fi

python3 "${SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/last30days.py" "$ARGUMENTS" --emit=compact
```

Use a **timeout of 300000** (5 minutes) on the Bash call. The script typically takes 1-3 minutes.

The script will automatically:
- Detect available API keys
- Run Reddit/X/YouTube searches
- Output ALL results including YouTube transcripts

**Read the ENTIRE output.** It contains THREE data sections in this order: Reddit items, X items, and YouTube items. If you miss the YouTube section, you will produce incomplete stats.

**YouTube items in the output look like:** `**{video_id}** (score:N) {channel_name} [N views, N likes]` followed by a title, URL, and optional transcript snippet. Count them and include them in your synthesis and stats block.

---

## STEP 2: DO WEBSEARCH AFTER SCRIPT COMPLETES

After the script finishes, do WebSearch to supplement with blogs, tutorials, and news.

For **ALL modes**, do WebSearch to supplement (or provide all data in web-only mode).

Choose search queries based on QUERY_TYPE:

**If RECOMMENDATIONS** ("best X", "top X", "what X should I use"):
- Search for: `best {TOPIC} recommendations`
- Search for: `{TOPIC} list examples`
- Search for: `most popular {TOPIC}`
- Goal: Find SPECIFIC NAMES of things, not generic advice

**If NEWS** ("what's happening with X", "X news"):
- Search for: `{TOPIC} news 2026`
- Search for: `{TOPIC} announcement update`
- Goal: Find current events and recent developments

**If PROMPTING** ("X prompts", "prompting for X"):
- Search for: `{TOPIC} prompts examples 2026`
- Search for: `{TOPIC} techniques tips`
- Goal: Find prompting techniques and examples to create copy-paste prompts

**If GENERAL** (default):
- Search for: `{TOPIC} 2026`
- Search for: `{TOPIC} discussion`
- Goal: Find what people are actually saying

For ALL query types:
- **USE THE USER'S EXACT TERMINOLOGY** - don't substitute or add tech names based on your knowledge
- EXCLUDE reddit.com, x.com, twitter.com (covered by script)
- INCLUDE: blogs, tutorials, docs, news, GitHub repos
- **DO NOT output "Sources:" list** - this is noise, we'll show stats at the end

**Options** (passed through from user's command):
- `--days=N` → Look back N days instead of 30 (e.g., `--days=7` for weekly roundup)
- `--quick` → Faster, fewer sources (8-12 each)
- (default) → Balanced (20-30 each)
- `--deep` → Comprehensive (50-70 Reddit, 40-60 X)

---

## Judge Agent: Synthesize All Sources

**After all searches complete, internally synthesize (don't display stats yet):**

The Judge Agent must:
1. Weight Reddit/X sources HIGHER (they have engagement signals: upvotes, likes)
2. Weight YouTube sources HIGH (they have views, likes, and transcript content)
3. Weight WebSearch sources LOWER (no engagement data)
4. Identify patterns that appear across ALL sources (strongest signals)
5. Note any contradictions between sources
6. Extract the top 3-5 actionable insights

**Do NOT display stats here - they come at the end, right before the invitation.**

---

## FIRST: Internalize the Research

**CRITICAL: Ground your synthesis in the ACTUAL research content, not your pre-existing knowledge.**

Read the research output carefully. Pay attention to:
- **Exact product/tool names** mentioned (e.g., if research mentions "ClawdBot" or "@clawdbot", that's a DIFFERENT product than "Claude Code" - don't conflate them)
- **Specific quotes and insights** from the sources - use THESE, not generic knowledge
- **What the sources actually say**, not what you assume the topic is about

**ANTI-PATTERN TO AVOID**: If user asks about "clawdbot skills" and research returns ClawdBot content (self-hosted AI agent), do NOT synthesize this as "Claude Code skills" just because both involve "skills". Read what the research actually says.

### If QUERY_TYPE = RECOMMENDATIONS

**CRITICAL: Extract SPECIFIC NAMES, not generic patterns.**

When user asks "best X" or "top X", they want a LIST of specific things:
- Scan research for specific product names, tool names, project names, skill names, etc.
- Count how many times each is mentioned
- Note which sources recommend each (Reddit thread, X post, blog)
- List them by popularity/mention count

**BAD synthesis for "best Claude Code skills":**
> "Skills are powerful. Keep them under 500 lines. Use progressive disclosure."

**GOOD synthesis for "best Claude Code skills":**
> "Most mentioned skills: /commit (5 mentions), remotion skill (4x), git-worktree (3x), /pr (3x). The Remotion announcement got 16K likes on X."

### For all QUERY_TYPEs

Identify from the ACTUAL RESEARCH OUTPUT:
- **PROMPT FORMAT** - Does research recommend JSON, structured params, natural language, keywords?
- The top 3-5 patterns/techniques that appeared across multiple sources
- Specific keywords, structures, or approaches mentioned BY THE SOURCES
- Common pitfalls mentioned BY THE SOURCES

---

## THEN: Show Summary + Invite Vision

**Display in this EXACT sequence:**

> **See:** `references/output-format.md` for "What I learned" display templates (by query type) and stats block format.

> **See:** `references/citation-rules.md` for citation format, priority, and URL formatting rules.

**LAST - Invitation (adapt to QUERY_TYPE):**

> **See:** `references/invitation-templates.md` for invitation templates by query type and example invitations.

---

## WAIT FOR USER'S RESPONSE

After showing the stats summary with your invitation, **STOP and wait** for the user to respond.

---

## WHEN USER RESPONDS

**Read their response and match the intent:**

- If they ask a **QUESTION** about the topic → Answer from your research (no new searches, no prompt)
- If they ask to **GO DEEPER** on a subtopic → Elaborate using your research findings
- If they describe something they want to **CREATE** → Write ONE perfect prompt (see below)
- If they ask for a **PROMPT** explicitly → Write ONE perfect prompt (see below)

**Only write a prompt when the user wants one.** Don't force a prompt on someone who asked "what could happen next with Iran."

### Writing a Prompt

When the user wants a prompt, write a **single, highly-tailored prompt** using your research expertise.

### CRITICAL: Match the FORMAT the research recommends

**If research says to use a specific prompt FORMAT, YOU MUST USE THAT FORMAT.**

**ANTI-PATTERN**: Research says "use JSON prompts with device specs" but you write plain prose. This defeats the entire purpose of the research.

### Quality Checklist (run before delivering):
- [ ] **FORMAT MATCHES RESEARCH** - If research said JSON/structured/etc, prompt IS that format
- [ ] Directly addresses what the user said they want to create
- [ ] Uses specific patterns/keywords discovered in research
- [ ] Ready to paste with zero edits (or minimal [PLACEHOLDERS] clearly marked)
- [ ] Appropriate length and style for TARGET_TOOL

### Output Format:

```
Here's your prompt for {TARGET_TOOL}:

---

[The actual prompt IN THE FORMAT THE RESEARCH RECOMMENDS]

---

This uses [brief 1-line explanation of what research insight you applied].
```

---

## IF USER ASKS FOR MORE OPTIONS

Only if they ask for alternatives or more prompts, provide 2-3 variations. Don't dump a prompt pack unless requested.

---

## AFTER EACH PROMPT: Stay in Expert Mode

> **See:** `references/invitation-templates.md` for post-prompt follow-up and output summary footer format.

---

## CONTEXT MEMORY

For the rest of this conversation, remember:
- **TOPIC**: {topic}
- **TARGET_TOOL**: {tool}
- **KEY PATTERNS**: {list the top 3-5 patterns you learned}
- **RESEARCH FINDINGS**: The key facts and insights from the research

**CRITICAL: After research is complete, you are now an EXPERT on this topic.**

When the user asks follow-up questions:
- **DO NOT run new WebSearches** - you already have the research
- **Answer from what you learned** - cite the Reddit threads, X posts, and web sources
- **If they ask a question** - answer it from your research findings
- **If they ask for a prompt** - write one using your expertise

Only do new research if the user explicitly asks about a DIFFERENT topic.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Asking about target tool before research** — The skill explicitly instructs NOT to ask about the target tool before running research. Run research first, then ask if it wasn't specified in the query.
2. **Confusing RECOMMENDATIONS vs. PROMPTING queries** — "Best X tools" (RECOMMENDATIONS) needs a ranked list of specific things. "X prompts" (PROMPTING) needs techniques and copy-paste prompts. Mixing these produces the wrong output.
3. **Skipping the 4-phase intent parse** — Jumping straight to searching without parsing TOPIC, TARGET_TOOL, and QUERY_TYPE leads to mismatched output format. Always parse intent first.
4. **Generic search terms** — Searching "AI tools" instead of site-specific queries like `site:reddit.com AI video tools last month`. Specific, time-bounded queries return actionable recent content.
5. **Ignoring engagement signals** — Summarizing low-upvote Reddit threads the same as high-upvote ones. Weight content by engagement; viral posts reflect actual community consensus.
